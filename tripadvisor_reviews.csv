"We did not make our connecting flight to pittsburgh due to fog, We were told no hotel vouchers were left, they ran out 11000 people were displaced that day. We could not fly out  for 2 days To just keep receipts and file a claim.

"Sorry but we have travelled on business class a few times now to Cape Town and Sydney.  This does not feel very special.   The lounge was packed, unclean and most of the electric points don’t work.     We had to queue with everyone else and we are paying business class prices.     The seats are basically for sardines.   You are crushed together and if you don’t know the person sitting next to you, you certainly will know everything by the time you get to your destination.   This must be the worst business class I have ever been on and we have now done several airlines.      Really not worth the cost of a ticket.    Spend it on hotels when you get there as you will need to rest well after the flight.    Terrible.",2.0,London,Tampa,International,March 2025,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0

"British Airways' booking system is broken, yet they'll blame YOU when it fails. Their system showed our flight as confirmed all the way until we arrived at the airport, where they suddenly claimed we didn't have a ticket. Their solution? Pay up or stay behind.

Customer service response? Nothing but pure gaslighting. 'It's PayPal's fault, wait no it's Gmail's fault wait no it's Microsoft Office's fault.... And well you should have known to look at your account portal to confirm you have a ticket even though you looked at your account portal and it said you had a ticket. But don't worry, we looked reeeaaaallllyyy hard at it, and if it were our fault, we would've apologized.'

After years as a loyal customer, I'm done. BA has mastered the art of creating problems and then making them your responsibility.

"The worst customer services I have ever came across. We are due to travel Premium Economy with BA from Glasgow to Tampa via London Gatwick on 4th April and return on 22nd April. BA have now informed me that they have changed the operator between Glasgow and Gatwick to Emerald Airlines which means a smaller turboprop aircraft instead of an A320. I have called BA asking for a refund for 2 passengers between  GLA-LGW & LGW-GLA as they are clostrophobic and can not travel on a smaller aircraft. 
We only booked these flights thinking that we were flying all the way with a national carrier BA. 
BA are refusing to offer a refund even though they have changed the terms and conditions. I have looked at other options to get to LGW (Easyjet), but BA have said the tickets 2 passengers will not be able to board the LGW - TPA flight at LGW if they do not board the Emerald Airlines flight at GLA. 
I will never book British Airways again, for a company the size of BA  ( a national carrier) to change the terms and conditions of a flight booked 5 weeks before travel but not offer any compensation/refund or even allow passengers to board at LGW is diabolical and falls way below any standards expected.",1.0,Glasgow,Tampa,International,March 2025,N/A,N/A,N/A,1.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

"My flight to Chicago was canceled. I was left without any customer service support and was told to call BA or try to use the app. After an hour of trying on the phone, I approached a member of staff luckily for me the person I approached was Jesse Saran. Rather than leave me on a call with BA that was not being answered. She took me over to a computer and made a call to British Airways Central and help me figure out a new connecting flight via DC which would save me a total of more than 36 hours. The call took a long time during which time her shift had formally ended and she was due to go home. Rather than handing me over to someone else or leaving me fend for myself she kindly stayed with me beyond her working hours, made me feel very taken care of and got me booked down for a new flight as smoothly as possible. She was kind and generous throughout a reminder of why people fly BA in the first place.

"I flew First Class to Hong Kong in November last year. Never again. There is about the same amount of room as there is in Cathay Pacific Business Class!. My reading light didn't work and discovered it was held together with gaffer tape...This is supposed to be First Class.  Very cramped toilet. The crew were very good and couldn't apologize enough. The decals on the seat adjustment buttons were worn away and it was hit and miss,even by the stewardess, making the seat move where I wanted it. I flew Cathay Pacific First Class the year before and oh my god what a difference. Airy and spacious. This was an older plane but that is no excuse when BA are charging a big,big premium.

"I travel extensively across most global airlines but I don't frequently take BA. I had 2 flights GVA-LHR and back in the last week on my way to the US:

2. They don't even apologize for the delay
3. Dirty plane with plastic, bottles and items from previous passengers
4. I flew premium Economy and the staff insisted on both BA flights that i had to check in my carry on while there was plenty of the space to keep my luggage.

"Disgusting aircraft with broken toilets, limescale, mould. Black mould by my head on the return over-night flight. Food was slop. Only one hot drink for what turned out to be 13 hour flight. Delays on each of the 4 flights. They broke out suitcase and refuse to refund us because we complained online after 7 days i.e. when we got home. We initially complained to them about this at baggage claim at the airport and they just said to claim when we got home- causing us to miss their ridiculous deadline for damage claims. No food, drink or compensation for any of the delays despite over 5hr delay getting home. Staff were miserable apart from 2 who were lovely.

"We flew business class from London Heathrow to Bangkok via Amman. Unfortunately, the first flight to Amman was with BA. It was delayed by more than 3 hours. We were informed of the delay at the check-in. BA knew that we would miss our connecting flight (Royal Jordanian) to Bangkok but they still let us check-in. When we approached the entrance to the flight cabin, I asked the attendant where the business class was. He said that I was standing in it. Actually, there was no difference to the economy seats. So we wasted our money booking a business class fare. They had just blocked the middle seat. There was not much leg room. We were duped! It was a flight from hell. There were drunkards having a party next to us in the aisle using foul language. When the flight was landing one woman asked for bottles of wine to take to her hotel room. The attendant was reluctant but then he gave up and let her have a couple of bottles. The attendants were supplying endless quantities of alcohol. They should have stopped serving. As we expected we missed our connection. An official at Amman airport wondered why BA let us catch the delayed flight. They could have easily put us on a different flight direct to Bangkok. We were driven to an awful transit hotel near the airport. We stayed there for 24 hours and caught the Royal Jordanian flight to Bangkok. The business class cabin was as it should be. We had a great flight. As soon as we got home in January 2025, my wife wrote a letter of complaint to the BA. They replied after a month thanking her for the feedback.

"I had such a bad experience. Wish it were easier to find alternatives to British Airways. My flight was delayed and the cabin crew told us that it was because a member of their staff at the gate made a mistake with the bags, causing my whole journey to be delayed and me to spend a lot more money.

Their advisor suggested a raise a claim which I wasted time doing (I think wasted time as it seems like they rejected my request, but I don't actually know).
They quote 4-8 week turnaround, and it took longer than 8 weeks for them to resolve the claim. I don't know how long in reality because they never sent me the answer. I had to check the website myself to find out it had been 'resolved'.

The experience is quite exhausting and totally rubbish, and soooo disappointing when you think it's supposed to be a premium airline with premium prices.

At least with budget airlines, the prices set you up to receive sub-par standard.",1.0,London,Bordeaux,Europe,November 2024,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
"The overall experience with British Airways was good. However, on the way back from London to Boston we have experienced a very unpleasant situation during boarding. The woman who was checking boarding passes was exceptionally rude, she straight out told my husband: “This is not a carry on!” ( referring to the carry on bag that we’ve been traveling with for the past 8 years and never had any issues), my husband was trying to tell her that , but she was continuously talking over him and demanded that the bag needs to be checked in. We were traveling with a small child and that was quite an embarrassing experience, since we had to move his extra clothes and snacks in the middle of the airport. Even though I understand, that sometimes airlines have to mandatory check in carry on luggage, there are way more civil ways to do that. We have never experienced anything like that and we’ve been flying for a long time.By the way, 4 compartments for the carry on luggage were empty during take off. There was no need to put us through this experience.

"My Dad, sister and I travelled to Barbados with British Airways in January 2025. It was our first time travelling in Business and we couldn’t have been happier! The BA lounge at Heathrow was fantastic, with so many options available for breakfast and lunch.

The flight itself was an amazing experience. We were each given a glass of champagne, and a bag filled with goods. In business lounge, you have your own set of headphones for the entertainment. The list of films available was far wider than what was on my last BA trip to India, which was a pleasant surprise.

The flight to Barbados was 9 hours but I’ve been on train rides and Uber journeys in the UK which seemed longer than this flight. There were two meals served, one just before take off and one an hour or so before landing. The food was of good quality. 

We took a night flight on our return to the UK. I rarely sleep on planes but I did on this flight. Again, the flight didn’t seem to be that long, and it was so comfortable. I’m going on Ryanair to France in a month, and I know I will be thinking about the BA flights to and from Barbados!

"I had an absolutely terrible experience with British Airways and their so-called 'customer service' that barely exists. Their website is a complete nightmare; it doesn’t show your bookings properly, making it incredibly frustrating to manage your tickets. Changing your flight is next to impossible, and the professionalism of their service is shockingly poor.

Honestly, even EasyJet is miles ahead of British Airways. Their website is user-friendly, allowing you to easily locate your bookings and make changes to names, dates, and even destinations without hassle. You won’t have to deal with unhelpful customer service representatives in India, which is a breath of fresh air.

British Airways is downright inflexible. They refused to change my flight destination or time when I was just 10 minutes late to the airport due to an accident. Instead of providing assistance, they canceled my booking without a second thought. Their customer service is non-existent.

I regret booking multiple flights with them, especially since some were canceled because I couldn’t find them on their app. Their app failed to add my bookings even though I booked well in advance, which left me scrambling to remember my travel plans.

In conclusion, I will never use British Airways again. If you want a reliable travel experience, I highly recommend choosing Ryanair, EasyJet, or Air France instead.",1.0,London,Nice,Europe,February 2025,N/A,N/A,N/A,1.0,1.0,N/A,1.0,N/A
"Flew Business to Japan last summer with the family and just got back from Economy to Doha.  We took an economy flight with Qatar airways after and the difference with BA is night and day.

I’ve always supported BA and loved the companion tickets but really their service is awful.

Qatar airways have fantastic staff, they look wonderful and stylish are kind and charming and energetic and the food is great.  By contrast the BA staff look scruffy and just can be very difficult in all classes when you need something.  Their new thing is for one of the meals to hand out a disgusting pastry lattice thing.  Honestly it’s laughable.  What about a simple sandwich instead?

As for the food - diabolical. The meal after take off pure rubbish. The breakfast a bacon and tomatoe sort of pie in a box - wet and dough like one end and crunchy the other. Hey Head of BA you try eating this garbage and see if you like it. Honestly Flagship carrier - dont make me laugh. IF YOU HAVE A CHOICE DONT FLY BA.

The flight was cancelled at very short notice without explanation at the airport where we were already in the waiting area. Hotel and bus vouchers were issued but the buses were totally overcrowded both to the hotel and back the next morning, so we were forced to take taxis.
These circumstances (flight cancellation, costs incurred) entitle us to compensation from the airline.
We were promised compensation in writing, but we will never receive it, because BA is no longer subject to European law, they can write and promise whatever they want. They don't give a damn.

I travelled (Today) Friday 21st February 2025 on from Heathrow Airport Terminal 5 17:20 service to Belfast City airport. All was fine in the actual airport and staff at the front of the cabin were welcoming as well as the older lady at the rear of the cabin. The flight was fully boarded and ready for departure and Doors secured. The captain done his usual announcements and said we would be departing the stand in approximately 5 minutes. Ten minutes passed and then the captain came on again saying due to the amount of traffic in the air waiting to enter terminal 5 we would leave the stand in approximately ten minutes. So another twenty minutes passed and eventually we had pushback. Further to this we got pushed back and hit another issue the pushback robot broke down in front of the plane and we had to then wait on engineers coming to solve this issue. We sat just out on the taxi way waiting. The seatbelt lights were on as soon as pushback took place meaning we were all sat waiting. Your cabin crew were seated waiting as well. We sat for a duration of time and during this we were stuck in our seats. The captain then came on and done another announcement saying we should not be much longer but did say he would switch off the engines meaning there would be no air conditioning as this does not function without a fully functional engine in operation. We sat and waited patiently and one of your cabin crew who was working at the rear of the cabin sitting on her jump seat and feet up on the toilet door. The colleague in question had dark hair and slim and hair in a bun who I believe was called Faye. We were all told to put our phones on flight mode prior to even taxiing of the stand. However your colleague Faye must have thought she was exempt sitting on her phone chatting to someone and texting also however passengers were advised to put there phones on flight mode meaning they could only carry out certain tasks on there devices. Personally I found this colleague rude and unprofessional and should be dealt with by your company accordingly. I have travelled with multiple airlines and never experienced poor service like this in my lifetime and unprofessional behaviour by the member of staff as per above. Further to this I feel like economy customers are treated like dirt by some of your colleagues one as per mentioned above and secondly your male colleague on board also who was cabin crew. I witnessed a young lad needing the bathroom after the seat belt sign went off needed the toilet and was basically told he had to use the rear of the aircraft bathroom. I felt that this was very inappropriate no matter what class the young lad was in who was probably no more than ten years old. Imagine if this was your child how would you feel about this? You would not tolerate it. All I am going to say is your two colleagues above require further training and to treat those how they would like to be treated. You show respect you get respect. It shouldn’t matter what class you are we are all paying customers at the end of the day and also we all enter the world the same way and leave the same way it doesn’t matter if you own a mansion or a council house we all still go to the same place at the end of life.,2.0,London,Belfast,Domestic,February 2025,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0
"This is a horrible company!!! I will never use their services. I bought a ticket on their website last month and I never received an email confirmation.

I asked to be a proration to refund me so I could book a ticket, but they made no effort, to help me knowing i was stuck and had no options!

"QUITE LITERALLY THE WORST AIRLINE. Their workers are INCREDIBLY RACIST and rude. I had a connecting flight from Newark airport to London Heathrow from where I would go to Istanbul. Because of British airways I missed my connecting flight from London Heathrow and consequently missed another flight that I was supposed to take from Istanbul. British Airways gave me another flight 3 hours later and did not offer any compensation for the flight that I was supposed to get on from Istanbul even though I missed it because their airplane did not reach its destination in time (WHICH IS THEIR FAULT). I WENT TO ASK THEM TO REIMBURSE MY TICKET FROM ISTANBUL TO MY FINAL DESTINATION since I HAD TO PAY AN EXTRA 200 on top of what I had already paid since all the times changed because of the new flu got they gave me. This made a ticket that should have cost 120 into one that costs 320.

On getting to the desk for the new flight ( already stressed) told the plane is fully booked, go back to T5- no more info provided at all

"On Sept 1st, 2024, I booked two return business class seats from Gatwick to Orlando and a rental car for travel between February 3rd and 13th, 2025, paying a total of £4499. 

Our outbound flight, despite a 2 hour plus delay due to a technical fault, was fine, and both the airport and onboard staff were excellent. However, the return journey was an entirely different experience—one that was both frustrating and unacceptable.

Lack of Transparency and Poor Communication

When attempting to check in online at 18.10 on the 12th Feb for our return flight, I encountered an unexplained 'error' at the step after I had advised the nos of bags. The error message gave no indication of what the problem was and advised that I would need to check in at the airport. I tried several times both online with a computer and through the app on my phone with always the same result.  I was anxious to check in as I wanted to select adjacent middle seats for my wife and I. I called British Airways US number (UK customer service was closed). The US operator attempted the check in but was unsuccessful and I was simply told to check in at the airport—no reason was provided. A second call the following morning to UK Executive club number yielded the same response. Despite my insistence, I was only assured that two middle seats had been requested for us.

It is now clear that the real reason for this 'error' was that BA had overbooked the flight but deliberately withheld this information. Had we been informed, we could have opted to change to another flight, including staying an extra night in Orlando or flying a day earlier on an undersold flight. Instead, British Airways failed to provide any proactive solutions, leaving us with no choice but to deal with the issue at the airport.

Unacceptable Downgrade and Disregard for Customers

Upon arrival at check-in, the problem became clear. The staff, who barely acknowledged us while remaining on the phone, finally informed us that one of us would be downgraded due to overbooking. No explanation was given, no apology was offered, and we were bluntly told to decide who would “choose” to move to a lower class.

During the flight, the situation became even more unacceptable. I voluntarily took the downgraded seat so that my wife could remain in business class. Shockingly, the passenger seated next to me informed me that he had called British Airways at approx. 8:00 PM the night before due to a mix up on his departure date and had actually been offered an upgrade to business class for an additional $4,000 on the very flight that I was actually being bumped down a class on—an offer he declined. This confirms that BA was actively trying to profit from upgrades while knowingly overbooking and failing to honour confirmed business class bookings.

A further revelation occurred when your cabin crew came to discuss the situation with me when she revealed that their records showed that the flight had in fact been overbooked for some time (ie more than 24 hours) which led me and my fellow passenger in seat 10B to speculate that perhaps it was now BA policy to try sell club class seats at a premium of $4000 and if this led to overbooking the unfortunate customer who had booked sometime in advance would just get bumped down a class . The passenger next to me said that he is a gold executive club member and is very willing to corroborate this. 

As a result, my wife spent her business class flight seated next to strangers instead of with me, and I endured an uncomfortable journey in a lower class than I had paid for, unable to sleep before a long drive home. The flight attendants were sympathetic and acknowledged the unfairness of the situation, but they could do little to fix what was clearly an appalling company policy.",1.0,Orlando,London,International,February 2025,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0

"It's been 2 weeks since my flight from Dubai was cancelled (meant to arrive at London at 5.30pm on 31st jan).
It was 1 hour since we had taken off from Dubai airport when fumes started coming out of the bathroom.
The captain decided to return and the BA show started:
We had to wait for 13 hours for the next flight, the information given was confusing and from those 13 hours of wait, the first 4 hours were spent waiting inside the plane without fresh air, along with immigration queues (that we should not have done), wrong information about whether we should pick up our luggage or not, and then ZERO indications about what step to take to get the next plane. 
Finally, I worked out that we had to actually go to 'Connections' and ask how we would be able to get on the next plane.
This is all carrying heavy hand luggage, and no water, food being offered by BA.

"I travelled on BA from NY to London recently - first thing of note on the outgoing trip was the food: awful. Barely edible l, overcooked, tasteless - some of the worst plane food I’ve tried in a while. Barely edible. Bar service was once, no one came round with soft drinks or water for the rest of the flight. Return flight same deal. 2.5 hours before the end of the flight I went to the back to ask for a glass of wine I was told ‘ no more alcohol other people on the plane have drank too much and we need enough left for the passengers on the return journey of this plane’ I rather incredulously pointed out that it was still a way to go till New York and at this point around 6pm local time so fairly reasonable for a passenger to ask for a glass of wine - they flatly denied me and said ‘we have a budget’ 
Suffice to say the staff the food and the service is not what it used to be: BA is aiming more for the Ryanair crowd these days which is fine but I suggest their prices reflect the budget service.",1.0,London,New York City,International,December 2024,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0

"First time parents traveling with their 10 month old daughter (her first ever flight). We had booked for a round trip through Chase Travel because we had points stacked up and we wanted to snag a good premium economy deal. At the check in counter in LAX, we were met with a rather rude, insensitive and entitled staff member. The layover in London was rather short (100 minutes)  and we were wondering if BA could assist by letting us get off the aircraft early or if they can assist us in any way to ensure we catch our connecting flight on time (FYI - this was the only option available, if we wanted a favorable return leg). The staff member was condescending and refused to offer any solution or help, even though we called to inform the customer care folks months in advance and were assured that the check in personnel would be able to assist. The flight journey in particular wasn’t anything special with the staff taking almost 2 hours to get a glass of hot water. As expected we made it to the connecting flight as the last ppl to board the flight. The icing on the cake was when we landed in Chennai (India) all of our checked in bags (5 in total including the all important baby bag) didn’t turn up. We had waited at baggage claim for a full 2 hours and when the baggage carrousel stopped, I had to go around searching for a representative who could assist. Only after searching for quite a bit, was I able to catch a hold of someone - and to our astonishment were told that all our bags were left behind in London.  Though we were able to get the bags within 48 hours, it was hard to arrange for stuff with a tired baby.

Thankfully we encountered  no luggage issues during our return leg and lowering our expectations for any form of acceptable service actually helped get through our journey smoothly.

Having premium economy and an infant matters zilch to airlines. The lack of empathy is appalling.

Overall I would have to say that this was my worst flight experience - especially having to share this miserable experience with my daughter, who was travelling for the very first time.

"We have always stayed loyal to BA but sadly we will not be travelling with them again. Premium Economy is now more Economy and less Premium. Cabin was dirty with sweets on the floor from previous flight, cabin crew offered me a tissue to pick them up. Vegetarian meal was inedible both outbound and inbound, a very long flight with no food.Ran out of on board meals so no alternative available. Lavatory situation was dire, sharing with Economy meant at least a 10 minute wait. Cabin crew were invisible for most of the flight, customer service was appalling, but  the laughter coming from the galley sounded like they were having a great time. 
So sad that a once great airline has lost it's sense of value  and the drop in standards is also very disappointing. There is a lot of competition from other airlines who offer competitive fares and far superior customer service.

"Traveled from Singapore on an overnight flight to London Heathrow on an Airbus A380. Check in and boarding went very smoothly, plane was very clean although seating was rather tight. We were seated on the lower deck to the rear of the plane. First meal service was ok (food average) although one cabin stewardess to say the least was a bit clumsy distributing the meal trays with one falling. The worst of the service came with the second meal (breakfast) when we at the rear were served with ours only 55 minutes before landing and not given a choice of meals as all the English breakfasts had gone so our choice was eat it or leave it and the meal we received was not good at all. One passenger asked our stewardess why we were so late in getting the meal to which she replied that it was a big plane to get all the meals out to people meaning my eyes that either there wasn’t enough cabin crew or service was started to late. Our stewardess in question spilt orange juice on my wife (aisle seat) while pouring to which she got one of her two favourite words (Sorry-Apologies) neither which were sincere and as the meal was served late extra cabin crew were brought down to help clear up in time for landing in which time the stewardess in question spilt tea on a gentleman while clearing away and her excuse was that someone had not drunk all there tea plus the usual Apologies. 
Have done many long haul flights with Virgin, Emirates and Qatar and British Airways and sadly the gap between the former 3 and British Airways is sadly getting bigger.

"I have never experienced such poor customer service in my life. It took me an entire month to reschedule my flight, during which I had to speak with multiple agents—each providing contradictory information, demonstrating a lack of knowledge, and failing to handle my case properly. I was repeatedly given incorrect charges, and when agents realized the complexity of my case, they simply hung up on me.

At first, I tried to remain patient and resolve the issue, but after four weeks of constant struggle, it became clear that British Airways does not prioritize its customers. Last week, after nearly two hours on the phone, I was assured that my card would be charged within 72 hours. A week later, no payment had been taken, and when I followed up, I was informed that an error had occurred—yet no one had contacted me via email or phone to rectify the situation. Instead, I was quoted a higher fee than before. Only when I refused to pay more did the agent offer the original price 'as a good gesture', as if the mistake had been mine rather than an issue with British Airways’ system.

Yesterday, my card was finally charged, and I decided to formally submit a complaint. The response I received was nothing more than a generic template email—offering no real acknowledgment of the issues I faced, no sincere apology, and no actual resolution. The email simply directed me to visit the website for general queries, which is entirely unacceptable.

This experience has confirmed why British Airways has such a poor reputation for customer service. I will never purchase a ticket from your airline again. When I faced a similar issue with KLM, it was resolved in a single 20-minute phone call, without unreasonable fees or unnecessary delays.

"We traveled on our dream trip to Italy last September and splurged on business class on British Airways from Seattle to Florence.  The flight itself was very pleasant, food and service was everything we expected.  That's the last positive thing I can say about this airlines.  Our flight was delayed, and the experience at Heathrow was a nightmare to get to our connecting flight.  We missed our connecting flight and there were no other flights that day, even though it was early in the morning.  After 3 hours we were put on a flight to Paris to connect with an AirFrance flight to get us into Florence later that evening.  Our flight out of London to Paris was delayed by 3 hours -- no explanation.  Missed our flight in Paris and got absolutely NO help from BA.  The staff in Paris rudely informed us they could do nothing and we had to get on the phone with customer service.  Spent an hour and half trying to get through to anyone in customer service -- #67 in line, disconnect.  #87 in line, disconnect.  Over and over.  We ended up paying for flights on AirFrance later that night -- $1,300 rather than lose another day and probably still never get through to customer service.   Arrived in Florence, no suitcases of course.  Took 3 days to get our luggage.  No explanation and just trying to get through to them is so frustrating.  Flight out of Rome back to Seattle was delayed by 2 hours -- again no explanation.  You'd think with a delay like that our bags would've made it on the flight.  Nope.  None of the bags from Rome-London made it on.  No explanation.  Made our flight to Seattle by the skin of our teeth, only to sit on the plane for 2-1/2 hours, again no explanation.  Baggage did not arrive in Seattle-- no surprise.  Only a handful of suitcases made it and most of the passengers on our flight ended up in line for lost baggage.

"I am writing to express my extreme disappointment and frustration with the treatment my family and I received from the British Airways staff at the Greece airport check-in desk on 07/02/2024.

Upon arriving at the check-in desk, we were met with rude and dismissive behavior from the staff member. They were unhelpful, displayed a lack of empathy and provided no assistance when we encountered issues with our booking. The level of customer service we experienced was completely unacceptable and left a negative impression on our entire travel experience.

We were left feeling disrespected and undervalued as customers and I believe that the behavior displayed by your staff does not align with the values and standards of British Airways. As a loyal customer, I expect a certain level of professionalism and courtesy when dealing with airline staff, especially when faced with challenges during travel.

I would appreciate a formal apology from British Airways regarding the treatment we received and assurance that steps will be taken to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. Additionally, I would like for the staff members involved to receive additional training on customer service and interpersonal skills to avoid further discontent among customers.

I trust that British Airways takes customer feedback seriously and will take immediate action to address this matter. I hope that a resolution can be reached promptly and that my faith in your airline can be restored.

"I only fly BA if I have no reasonable alternative. Premium Economy is anything but premium:

* the seats are impossible to adjust without placing one foot on the seat in front and pushing back on your own seat as hard as you possibly can, whereupon it shoots rearwards, hitting the peson behind you in the face

* the 'adjustable' entertainment screen doesn't adjust sufficiently to compensate for the person in front reclining their seat. If you have eyes that can be removed and held pointing upwards then you'll be fine. otherwise not

* use the call bell at last three times to stand any chance of cabin crew bothering to amble in your direction

* actually be offered anything? Pah, no chance. Give you one drink, feed you then turn off the cabin lights and it's Sayonara from the cabin crew

* ditto tea or coffee after 'dinner'? Or a second glass of water/orange juice/wine? Not a hope. You could ask, I suppose, but that's not really being offered a service, is it? And definitley not Premium service.

* constant interruptions to 'check' your seatbelt is on as the Fasten seatbelt sign is lit, permanently, despite the flight being like a millpond. When I finally went into Business Class to ask why we had not been offered tea or coffee with breakfast I was told, by a stewardess asking a Business Class passenger whether they'd like more coffee, that they could not serve hot drinks when the Fasten Setbelt sign was lit.  I politely pointed out that by this logic either hot drinks could be served to everyone, or they could not be served to anyone, I also asked why the seatbelt sign had been lit for almost the entire 11 hour journey.  She later came to tell me that 'the pilot forgot to turn it off'.  Oh well, that's ok then.

'Today, I was refused check-in by British Airways check-in staff at Warsaw Chopin airport.
I went to the British Airways check-in counter in Warsaw Chopin airport at 05:30 am (2 hours before departure) today 25/11/2024 to check-in for my flight to London and Chennai and presented the attached documents which shows my granted Indian visa on arrival (ETA) along with my valid Polish passport. The check-in counter lady insisted I provide the visa on a pdf with my photo on it, which I don't have, and which was not sent to me by the visa issuing authority. The attached document, which is an email approval of the visa on arrival for me, clearly states my name and passport number and that Visa is granted and available at The destination airport. The passport and this print-out was presented to your check-in staff. In-spite of my requests and pleas for nearly 2 hours, none of the 3 check-in staff helped me, and in fact were very rude. They kept pushing me away saying they have to serve other passengers. Further, they offered no assistance to re-book me on another flight nor did they offer any other alternate choices in my travel plans. I have just discovered from Customer Service that they marked me as 'no show' and as a result I lost money on the ticket that I bought. I also paid for an aisle seat on the London-Chennai leg which I lost and paid for lounge access in Heathrow Terminal 5 which I also lost. I incurred all these losses just because your check-in staff found it easier to kick me off my flight rather than try and read the documents I submitted to them and help with changes in flight dates etc. To get a pdf from the Visa issuing authorities I would need 1 day. They had few options but they simply closed the counter and disappeared without a word. This behavior is unacceptable and unexpected from a well-known airline such as British Airways. I am very disappointed in your handling of a simple issue. I have incurred a lot of stress and loss of health (I have a severe headache and body ache from the stress they created for me) because of your staff being untrained and unprofessional in their approach to me. Your staff are unprofessional and not empathetic to passengers who have physical difficulties. I am a senior citizen, am not computer savvy, can't see too well and am unable to conjure and produce a pdf visa with my photo on it, if the issuing authority did not send it to me. How am I supposed to know what British Airways expect from passengers ? On the BA website, Visa section, there is no information of any printed pdf with photo requirement. It stated that I must have a Visa and I had one ! One more point is that your staff rudely said 'go and get the Visa pdf printed somewhere. Without a printed pdf we will not check you in'. And this was said by your supervisor on duty. How can you allow your staff to treat a senior citizen this way ? You usually give impeccable and helpful service whenever I traveled from Heathrow. How can you allow this standard to depreciate so much, when out of London ? How do you plan to compensate me for my losses ? My loss in the ticket expenses, seat booking expenses, lounge expense, my taxi travel to Warsaw airport and back home. Please do let me know. I am very keen to receive a reply from you. Thank you very much in advance. '
Upto date I have not received compensation, nor a re-booking proposal. I am attaching print screens of 2 emails received from BA with some standard corporate jargon but nothing concrete resulted in my complaint. All my emails to Customer Service remain unanswered. This is the worst airlines I have come across. They have the opportunity to solve this situation and yet choose to ignore me. I want a refund or a new ticket to travel again (I travel to Chennai 5 times yearly). It is not my fault that their check-in Staff is not upto date on Visa and document requirements for India. Btw, I travelled to Chennai a few days later by Qatar Airways using exactly the same ETA (ELECTRONIC TRAVEL AUTHORIZATION) email and they (Qatar) did not demand any pdf with a photo on it, nor any print -out etc. I travelled to Chennai and back with no problems at all. There is something seriously wrong with British Airways and their customer service. I forewarn all travellers not to use British Airways for their travels to India especially if the start of the journey is out of London. The Staff is incompetent, rude and unprofessional.

"BA cancelled our direct flight and suggested no options. Under pressure they offerred an indirect flight in a downgraded cabin.  They will not pay compensation so I have referred the issue to the CEDR who cannot process the dispute because BA have not issued a 'final response' which is defined by CEDR as follows:

For clarity a ‘final response’ from British Airways will either: 1. Refer you directly to CEDR 2. Use the phrase ‘final response’ or 3. Use the phrase ‘we will not change our decision’ 4. Or ‘We will not reply further on this claim’ The email that states British Airways refuses your claim is unfortunately not considered as a final response.  

BA had closed the case without a final response.  I got the case re-opened and asked for one.  Today I received an almost identical email to the original. It said the cancellation was for 'operational reasons' with no further explanation and did not address issues about delay, re-routing and downgrading.  Most significantly, it was NOT a 'final response'.  Online tracking shows that BA has closed the case again.  

This is an appalling way to avoid claims and I have no doubt I am not the first person to suffer under this new dodgy tactic.  If it has happened to you let the world know.

One thing is clear, I will get this case heard and will get my compensation.  What is unclear is, after 30 years as a BA Executive Club member, I will ever fly with British Airways again.",1.0,Nashville,London,International,November 2024,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

So, we booked Business Class back from Bangkok. First problem the lounge. There is no BA lounge in Bangkok so we were directed to the Miracle Lounge. Nothing like a proper Business Class lounge, truly awful. No seats, poor food, terrible.

Then boarding. Business Class boarded first, then every one else boarded through our cabin. No friendly welcome No drink service until all the other passengers had passed through.

Seats were awful. The person in front of me had to step over my legs to get out. Seats poorly configured and not particularly comfortable.

"Having already submitted a review on my outbound flight, I thought it only fair to review the return as well. Truthfully there isn't much to comment on other than it was what I have now come to expect from business class. An unexpected delight was that I found the aircraft had now been fitted with the new configuration, with all window seats facing outwards and not the old style ying-yang configuration where you have to step over someone to get to your seat. The arrangement is far more convenient, with better storage space and altogether more privacy. There is even a handy little sliding cubicle door which when shut affords almost total privacy.

The meals on board were rather good. I opted for the goat's cheese, grilled asparagus, tomato confit, artichoke hearts, truffled honey cream starter. For the main course, seared halibut with baby carrots, Swiss chard and Lyonnaise potatoes in white wine cream sauce. Excellent. This was finished off with a rather agreeable cheese plate, (cheese board with crackers, walnuts, grapes and quince) and the whole thing was accompanied by a very pleasant IPA. Service was as usual pretty slick, other than the cabin crew neglecting to clear my dinner tray. I did try the call button, but to no avail. It seems they don't take any notice, so I had to physically fetch someone. Annoying, and really shouldn't happen. Another puzzling thing, but apparently part of the service, is the crew handing out hot towels. I really don't see the point, nor what issue this is designed to resolve - it is not something anybody incorporates into their everyday routine. There was the usual 'breakfast' service about an hour before landing, which was yoghurt with raspberry coulis, a ham, fried egg and honey mustard brioche bun, warm chocolate chip muffin and orange juice (see pictures). It looked great, but the brioche was pretty tasteless, although I hope that was down to the altitude and nothing else.",5.0,Houston,London,International,January 2025,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0
"Sunday 26th January we were travelling on board British Airways Flight BA 2158 from Grenada to London Gatwick.

We were due to depart from Maurice Bishop International Airport at 18.45 (local time) arriving back in Gatwick at 08.55 (local time) Grenada is four hours behind. This was a total journey time of 10 hours and 10 minutes.

There was a scheduled stop in St Lucia where we were due to land at 19.40, a fifty-five flight, from Grenada, and depart from there at 20.40.

Our journey began in Grenada when boarding commenced at 18.10 and was completed by 18.30 and doors shut the aircraft pushed push back from the Terminal and we were airborne at 18.50

Before departure we were offered a glass of water or orange juice. There was an announcement which informed us that the flight time to St Lucia would be thirty minutes. 

We were travelling in the World Traveller Plus Cabin for additional comfort and space due to the length of the flight.

On our seats was a, pillow, blanket, headsets and a minimal amenity kit were waiting for us when we boarded.

We landed in St Lucia at 19.20, we were advised that we would be on the ground for about an hour.

A new crew boarded as well the passengers joining the flight. When boarding completed 
the doors closed and we were airborne again  at 20.33.

We were informed that the flight to Gatwick would be about seven hours, expected to land much earlier than scheduled. We were expected to arrive at 07.37 almost eighty minutes earlier than scheduled 

Around half an hour into the flight we were offered drinks from the bar, we were also given the menu card.

Must say we thought that the meal options were unimaginative and not very inviting. It comprised of a starter of Quinoa salad with corn and tomato. The main course choices were, Caribbean chicken curry with rice and butternut squash or Garlic and lemon mahi mahi. The vegetarian option was aubergine cannelloni, spinach and cheddar.

The dessert chocolate brownie, cheese and biscuits.

About ninety minutes after take-off dinner was served with a choice of red or white wine. We went with the curry option, the chicken was hard and rather nasty, so was not eaten. 

The trays were cleared in and the cabin lights dimmed to allow passengers sleep.

With about eighty minutes before landing a light snack was served, there was a choice of a ham and cheese or tomato and cheese croissant. Oh dear it was so over baked it was like cardboard.

The return flight was rather a different experience when compared to the outbound flight on the 12th January.  This flight was more akin to a charter flight rather than the World Traveller Plus Cabin on a scheduled Airline.

We landed in Gatwick at 07.35 which was a welcome eighty minutes earlier than scheduled, which was the only redeeming feature of the flight.",3.0,Grenada,London,International,January 2025,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,1.0

"I am a very critical reviewer when it comes to British Airways and have no heistation in continuing to be honestly negative when it comes to the inefficieny of their Customer Relations Department, which continues to be the worst in the worldwide industry from my own experience. This is the first time this reviewer has ever scored them higher than 1*.

The plane was in good condition and on time for my entire itinerary.  Food quality was surprisingly good,

One thing that did disappoint me was that random seats were all allocated before online check in took place and this should be reconsidered as it makes it impossible for a passenger to select their own seat on a busy flight unless they pay the penal charges for pre-booking.

"On 5th January, British Airways cancelled my flight from Porto - London with less than 4 hours notice. I was sent new tickets for flights leaving Porto on the 8th January (3 days later) with no alternative. The flight cancelled was due to 'operational challenges' and not weather related as Easyjet, Rynair departed Porto - Gatwick that evening and all incoming flights at Gatwick landing around the same time had no issue.

After spending 30 minutes on the phone with a customer representative, I was booked onto a new flight leaving Porto at 09:55PM, arriving in Barcelona at 00:35 and a new flight to London at 07:55. As I had a very important meeting that morning, I had no option but to take this. Of course, I checked into a hotel give the layover and Barcelona airport closing.

My first claim was closed without any notification and I have since submitted 4 claims which automatically are getting closed with no reasoning or update. I can see this as I go to track the case. I have spent about 2 hours on the phone to customer representatives who have no idea of whats going on and keep telling me to keep submitting new cases. Every new case that is submitted is just auto closed by the next day. Possibly the worst customer service I have recieved. What is worse, my parents in their mid to late 60s were on the same flight as me and had to experience the same travel nightmare.

"Booking Ref V5NAFM. We booked a near £7k holiday with BA (flights and hotel) last summer for Christmas and New Year in Paphos Cyprus.  First the flight times were changed, then the flights were cancelled.  With great difficulty we finally managed to talk to someone, who was helpful and changed our flights to Larnaca, Cyprus, with a private premium car to taxi us to Paphos a hour and a half away.   That all worked OK, although for someone like me with BPH a long trip is always a concern.   The hotel and the holiday was great.  But the return trip was very disappointing.  To start with the premium car was changed to a noisy, uncomfortable mini bus.  The BA paperwork said 'Online check-in not available, Self-service  check-in not available, Airport check-in not available.   So I tried online and it worked, until we reached the airport, where there is no bag drop, so we checked in, for the second time, at a desk.  The flight was the same as the outward flight, boring with no screen for entertainment, no free drinks or food and no premium economy.   We are used to long haul not budget short haul.   Then the worst part, steps were brought to the plane and we had to descend the steps, cross the tarmac in the rain and climb a lot more steps inside the building.  We don't do steps very well these days, one of the reasons we fligh BA.

"I had an incredibly frustrating experience with British Airways, and I feel compelled to share it in the strongest possible terms. On 23 January, I attempted to add luggage to my booking. What should have been a simple task turned into a nightmare. After spending over an hour trying to complete the transaction with two different cards, the system informed me that the luggage had not been booked—yet both cards were charged! One card showed a completed transaction, and the other had a pending charge.

I called customer service that evening, spending another 45 minutes on the phone. I was informed that the luggage had indeed been purchased, despite this not appearing in my app. They also assured me that the pending charge on my first card would be released within 24 hours. Yet here I am, three days later (26 January), and the amount is still blocked.

When I called again, I was told that the pending amount might take up to seven days to be released and that they could not assist further. This is completely unacceptable.

To make matters worse, on both occasions, I selected the option to receive a feedback call and specifically reminded the customer service representatives to ensure I would get one. Unsurprisingly, I have not received any feedback calls after either interaction.

This experience has left me deeply disappointed in British Airways. The inefficiency of the booking system, the lack of clarity regarding charges, and the poor follow-through on customer feedback are not what I expect from a company of this calibre. I strongly urge British Airways to prioritise fixing these issues and improving their customer service experience.",1.0,Canton of Geneva,London,Europe,January 2025,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
I was boarding the plane and being chatted to by another male passenger who later made me feel super uncomfortable. Unfortunately he was seated in the row next to me and was making it clear that he wanted to come and sit with me as there were empty seats next to me. I discreetly made the cabin crew aware and management immediately came to speak to me and double upgraded me into business. I was incredibly grateful to the cabin crew for going to such great lengths to make my flight more comfortable. Was one of the kindest things I've experienced from a group of women and felt as though British Airways was committed to making me feel safe on the flight.,5.0,Hamilton,London,International,January 2025,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

"Neither of the two meals I was presented with on a 12-hour return flight from Mauritius to London came close to meeting even the most basic standard of acceptability, in my opinion — forcing me to reject both offerings outright. Now, I understand that “acceptability” is a subjective concept, one influenced by variables such as hunger, expectation, pleasure, value, and experience. But let us, for argument’s sake, break this down scientifically.

If we imagine acceptability as an equation, the hunger parameter can be ramped up to extreme levels — say, literal starvation. At such a point, hunger would become the overriding factor, obliterating all other variables like expectation or value in order to force the equation to balance. In simple terms, if I were starving to the brink of death, I might — might — find myself able to choke down what British Airways served as food. But even then, I would expect my body to stage a protest, refusing to release even a single thank-you chemical as the dense, flavorless sludge made its torturous descent down my throat.

Now, presumably, British Airways has factored food costs into their operational model, allocating resources across class tiers. Economy passengers, naturally, sit at the lowest rung of this culinary hierarchy, where the primary objective seems to be minimal expense rather than basic edibility. While I’m not privy to the exact pennies allocated per meal, I think it’s safe to say the number hovers somewhere between “insignificant” and “negligible.” And it shows.

To put the issue in perspective, let’s remove the context of airline dining and imagine this food being served in any other setting. Could such a meal sustain a restaurant of any kind — no matter how modest? Unlikely. Would a diner or even a high-school cafeteria consider this acceptable fare? Absolutely not. The closest comparison would be mass-produced institutional food: prisons, perhaps, or the kind of hospitals where patients prefer to discharge themselves early rather than face another tray. Even those establishments, however, occasionally stumble upon flavor or nutrition, however accidental.

It’s as if British Airways has engineered their meals specifically to challenge the very definition of food. It serves no purpose beyond reminding passengers that, yes, they paid for economy class, and therefore their suffering is, in some way, deserved. In fact, the meal is so egregiously bad that it transcends the realm of disappointment and enters into existential commentary — a bleak reflection on humanity’s willingness to endure misery for the sake of budget travel.

In conclusion, British Airways has set a new standard in inflight dining, one that redefines the phrase “bare minimum” and leaves passengers not just dissatisfied but actively disillusioned. If their goal was to ensure that nobody, ever, mistakes economy class for anything remotely pleasant, then congratulations — they’ve succeeded with flying colours.",1.0,Mahebourg,London,International,January 2025,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
"Very good service overall from BA. Arrived on time.

The outbound flight was very uncomfortable as the person in front of me released their seat forcefully into my lap after about half and hour of the flight.

"DO NOT BOOK if traveling with children- EVEN if you pay to upgrade your seats-you are NOT guaranteed those seats or to sit together
BRITISH AIRWAYS took our paid upgrade seats and scattered us in the back of the plane in MIDDLE seats.  Our child was made to sit 6 several rows ahead of us in between 2 strangers!  

We checked into our flights 20 hours before departure and had our seats that we paid to upgrade were still there.  Once we checked our luggage at the airport they gave us our boarding passes.  I didn't look at them, why would I check them.  On our short flight to London I noticed that our paid upgraded seats were changed and we were sitting in the back of the plane all scattered in middle seats.  
Ticket agent said our flight was full and nothing he could do.   
SEE ATTACHED PHOTO with BA seat changes policy... which was NOT followed.
Our aircraft did not change since other people were sitting in our paid seats.
Our 14 year old daughter's seat was several rows ahead of any of us and made to sit between 2 strangers.   No one would swap seats for a middle seat.   This was an 8 hour flight!

"British Airways Flight BA 2161
ISL – LGW
6th January 2025

I’ve 2 weeks to post this – because I didn’t want to “type angry” – but found that over the last few days my anger has not lessened.

The cabin crew staff were constantly rude and ignored simple requests by not only me but other passengers.  Not to mention the unhygienic and contaminated meal we were served.  This is my experience of he above flight

Requesting hot water
By all means a simple request as my mum and I had sore throats and could not drink the chilled water offered.  I asked for hot water 5 times of Cabin crew Joe & Cabin Crew Susan for over an hour and 10 mins.  Each time being told “we don’t have hot water on this trolley.  I’ll bring it on the next trolley”
They failed to do this on 5 trolleys.
After complaining to Cabin Crew Susan that we had not had any water since take off and over an hour of multiple requests she simply said “oh, ok”.  We were then served tepid water.

The unhygienic and contaminated meals
As my mum is diabetic and needs meals at specific times, I requested a Muslim meal.  Cabin Crew Joe served us UNCOVERED meals.  The foil had been completely removed, ruffled from both and then just placed on top.  When I said to him “this is not a sealed meal”.  His unbothered response was “all meals are sealed.”  I returned the one offered to me as I was disgusted by it.  My mum, unfortunately had to eat hers as her blood sugar would then drop.  She said it tased “awful” and could only have a couple of mouthfuls.  I then had to monitor and ensure that for the remainder of the flight her blood sugar didn’t drop.
My only regret is that I did not take pictures of the meals.
Again- as a diabetic, she did not have any water for the entire meal. 

The passenger behind me with a neuro-divergent child
Her child had been somewhat agitated the entire flight and she was trying her best to calm him.  The time the meal was served he was being slightly more agitated, and so she asked one of the staff walking past to take the meals away as he was beginning to pick at and throw the items.  The staff simply said “oh, I can’t. I’m only helping with the drinks”.  This staff was walking down to the back of the plane with no trolley – both her hands were free.  The mother of the child then pleaded saying “he’s throwing things – please take it”.  The staff then walked away.

Why are these staff in the service industry when they obviously could not care less about the service they provide.
Or was it simply because we were Pakistani and deserved such an awful service?
BA is as awful as people say and I would not use them again
Thankfully there are now other choices of travel to Pakistan.

"I took a British Airways flight recently due to an emergency, and while I usually avoid them because of their bad reviews, I didn’t have much of a choice. Unfortunately, the experience was just as disappointing as I had feared.

Even at 5'1', I found the seats incredibly uncomfortable, which says a lot. There was barely any room, and the overall seating experience felt cramped and unpleasant. The meal was beyond basic—uninspiring and lacking the quality you'd hope for.

Oddly enough, the highlight of the flight was the safety video, which was well-made and enjoyable. At least it added a small moment of entertainment!

The only other saving grace was the staff, who were kind and polite throughout the flight. Despite their efforts, the overall experience left much to be desired.

"Aircraft was changed on day of departure. Not much of a problem for me as I was changed from mid-row to front row aisle seat. Plenty of legroom. Those not seated in front row appeared to have good leg room. The extra width in Premium Economy was very helpful. 
Aircraft was 20 mins late departing but made up time landing 5 mins late in Bangkok.
Halfway through flight an odd little vibration could be felt throughout Premium Economy, don't know about rest of aircraft.
Nice blanket and pillow provided, as were eye mask and socks, toothbrush, toothpaste and lip balm.
The food menu was limited but the main meal itself was very good, last year I flew Cathay Pacific Business Class Heathrow to Bangkok via Hong Kong and BA's food was much better.
I don't drink alcohol and there was only Coke diet, which I don't like so water was my go to drink as I need low sugar drinks.
Why do airlines insist on putting mild cheddar cheese on the food tray. It tastes like soft plastic (consistency and flavour). Either use a strong cheddar or don't include cheese.
Had full English breakfast which was very good.
I will note that Tea/Coffee was very limited, big shame. Also would have been useful to have water or juice taken round the cabin during flight.
Cabin staff very pleasant and on hand if/when called.
Announcements from the flight were basically useless. No volume and often garbled.
Think this must have been a revamped aircraft as seating was quite comfortable for a 12 hour flight. Though after 9 or ten hours the backside did feel it !
Also, the Business Class section had  1-2-1 seating layout. Much better than the older layout.

"With it being five years since I last made this trip, it is nice to see that the same excellent level of service has been maintained. And since my last trip was pre-Covid, it was nice of BA to let me keep all my Avios loyalty points too. The aircraft was a Boeing 787 with the old style ying-yang configuration in the Business Class cabin, but that was no problem as I had booked well in advance and reserved the window seat in the very last row of the cabin, which is the only one with direct aisle access - i.e. you don't have to step over anyone to get out of your seat.

The flight was late departing Heathrow, but we were all kept updated via text, which was handy and appreciated. The captain later explained that the aircraft was a last-minute substitution, so they did pretty well in getting off at 10.20 compared to the original scheduled time of 9.30.

Now to the food. The options were for starters Scottish smoked salmon, or Italian burrata or British charcuterie plate. Having tried the burrata on a previous trip, I opted for the smoked salmon this time. This was perfectly fine, if a little meagre, but served with a small bowl of chopped fruit and a crusty brioche bun. The main course options were Herefordshire beef fillet or traditional Christmas dinner or Christmas nut roast. I had the beef, which was served in a peppercorn sauce and was actually very good. Dessert was a chocolate and salted caramel praline bar. All very enjoyable. Later in the flight, with a couple of hours until landing, there is also the ubiquitous afternoon tea. This is essentially three small finger sandwiches, fruit cake, chocolate eclair and scone with jam and clotted cream (see pictures).

Service throughout was as usual friendly and efficient, and despite the late departure, still arrived within a minimal delay that almost went unnoticed. A great service all round.",5.0,London,Houston,International,December 2024,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0

"Date and time of travel / incident:
10.1.25 Boarding time 17.50

Terminal: -3 
Flight number: BA 257

We were in group 6 called to board. 

Whilst boarding the aircraft  we had to go down anescalator that took us down to board the plane. So people from the plane had backed up. The space at the bottom of the escalator was small. But jam packed. No one could move. I turned and tried to walk up escalator. Somone shouted to people to stop getting on at top. I shouted for somone to hit the emergency stop button and when they did it failed. 

A lady dropped her hand bag upside down. Most of the people affected were Indian. 

I’m not exaggerating but people could have died. 

Not one member of staff was involved. I think approx three members of staff were upstairs checking the boarding pass and letting you through. Then you turned a corner and went down an escalator. 

We had already missed our connection on the 11 am flight and after our treatment already by BA that day we just wanted to get on the plane. We were traveling to India for our wedding and a spiritual gathering. We reached India one day late so missed wedding  dress fittings. Hotel per night driver all extra expense. I felt so nauseous after this accident and although I only had half a sandwich all day (because BA do not provide you with adequate funds)  I did not eat anything at all on the flight either because of this incident. Even the Air steward asked if I was ok. 

The air staff treated each other with contempt and were rude to each other. 

On one point though as you are responsible for the welfare of customers you should know how BA treat people concerning food and drinks. 

When we missed our connection we were given a £10.00 voucher each when our new flight to New Delhi  was 8 hours away. That means from leaving our home at 6.45 am until maybe two hours into the Delhi flight when you were served food 8 PMwe were given £20.00 between us. We managed to buy one sandwich to share a cup of tea each and a packet of crisps each at a cost of £20.90 from Cafe Nero. We did discuss this at the customer service desk but Natasha said she could not give us anything. No water nothing. I’m sure this is against the law and something you should be aware of. 

We were premium economy but were given economy seats but not together either. 

We could never have made our connecting flight even without the half hour delay. When other flights were available departing in 90 mins the BA staff said we would not make them.

"I already wrote a review for traveling to venice which was already a bad experience, tldr british airways lost the luggage of 20+ people in my group and was ridiculously unhelpful about information and getting it back, we all had been wearing the same dirty sweaty clothes for 24-48 hours and were miserable the first day of our trip. The reutrn flight yesterday has just continued my nightmare. Given the initial situation, i re-adjusted my packing so i would only have to check one bag instead of two. i double checked the weight and size requirements of my carry-on and it met all the rules. upon reaching the desk to check my baggage i was told i couldnt take my carry-on and i MUST check both bags because the flight was full and i was in group 7. whatever, i complied despite the feeling that they would lose my stuff AGAIN. on both my initial flight to london and my connecting flight to philadelphia there was, however, plently of space in the overhead for my bag. Upon landing, my nightmare continued when my airtags in my bag were still saying they were in england. upon reaching baggage claim i did find the suitcase that i was planning to check anyways. i did not find the bag that they had MADE me check. upon talking to a gentleman working there i found that i was in fact on a list of people whose bags did not reach philadelphia and given instructions on how to fill out a claim. while this guy was insanely more helpful than the employees at the italian airport, there are not words to describe how angry i am that my bag has been lost AGAIN, and it couldve been avoided if they didnt FORCE me to check it. i will never EVER fly with british airways ever again and i will be telling anyone that will listen to me to do the same.",1.0,Venice,Philadelphia,International,January 2025,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0
"Last August we had the misfortune of flying with British Airways and it was by far one of the worst travel experiences we have ever had.

We had booked tickets from BER to LAX with a stopover at Heathrow (LHR). The problems started when we couldn't check in online and at Berlin airport (BER) the check-in desk told us that they couldn't issue our boarding passes for the flight from LHR to LAX and we would have to get them at Heathrow.

The situation worsened when our flight from BER to LHR was delayed, leaving us with little time to take care of things at LHR. When we arrived, the check-in desk for our connecting flight was packed with a long queue. Although we rushed, we didn't have enough time to get our boarding passes. When we finally got to the counter, we were told that it was too late to board the plane and told to queue again at the British Airways service desk to resolve the issue of the replacement flight.

We stood in line for hours, only to be told that there were no flights to Los Angeles that day. We were forced to stay overnight in London, losing more than a full day at our destination. To make matters worse, British Airways did not offer compensation for accommodation, transportation and meal vouchers, so we had to cover all the unexpected costs ourselves, with staff assuring us that we could claim reimbursement at a later date.

After the trip, we submitted a claim, explaining the delay and how the crowded desks at LHR caused us to miss our flight. British Airways rejected our claim, citing that there was enough time to board the flight after the delay - although the delay and chaotic situation to get boarding passes at LHR airport made that impossible.

We lost valuable time at our destination, had to deal with unexpected costs, and did not receive any compensation. This experience really eroded our trust in British Airways, as they did not value and treat us fairly as customers.",1.0,Berlin,Los Angeles,International,August 2024,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

"My partner was flying to meet me in Cancun from the UK.  According to the official Mexican website and via email from the Mexican Embassy in the UK, he could visit Mexico using his UK tourist visa.  The British Airways staff at Gatwick at first refused to let him fly, then said they would rebook him the next day, then back they wouldn’t let him fly. One of the staff told me that Cancun had different entry requirements from the rest of Mexico but could not point to any written documentation of that.    I’m pretty sure it was a CYA lie, but what really caught my attention was the condescending and dismissive way they spoke to him. I’m proud that he managed to keep his cool.  

Even though we had thoroughly researched entry requirements, British Airways still would not allow him to travel and will not refund the fare.  We spent a a good deal of money for this impromptu vacation and now it is ruined.   We thought about purchasing from one of the lower cost carriers, but opted for British Airways because we thought it would be a more reputable choice.  We were sadly mistaken.

"I am writing to express my deep dissatisfaction with the service my party and I received on our recent flights with British Airways. We traveled from Heathrow to Las Vegas; eight of us in total.

The service on the outbound flight to Las Vegas was particularly disappointing. The flight attendants were extremely rude, and there was noticeable tension among them, which made us feel very uncomfortable. This included eye-rolling and under-the-breath remarks, which is highly unprofessional. Additionally, as we were seated at the back of the plane, only pasta was available by the time the food service reached us. The aircraft was also inadequately stocked and ran out of gin, Baileys, and even Coke early in the flight. The remaining options were wine, rum, whisky, and ginger ale. This is unacceptable, especially considering the high cost of the tickets and the expectation of a full range of food and drink options. The tray table was also filthy with evidence of a red wine spillage. I had to clean it up myself.

While the staff was more professional on the return flight, the service was still subpar. I was only provided with a tiny bottle of water and one Coke for the entire flight, which lasted 10 hours and 45 minutes. Drinks were skipped during meal service, and when I requested another Coke, I was told it had been put away, only to see another passenger receive a tea shortly after.

To add to our disappointment, upon arrival at Heathrow, one of my friend’s suitcase wheels was ripped off, further compounding our negative experience.

I have been a loyal British Airways customer for many years, but I am sorry to say that the service and quality on board have significantly deteriorated. While the ground staff in London and Las Vegas were excellent, the in-flight experience was far from satisfactory. Running out of drinks and limiting passengers to only two drinks on a long-haul flight is unacceptable.

I naturally decided to seek compensation for the inconvenience and discomfort experienced during our flights. After waiting 28 days for BA to respond, I chased them up, only to receive an offer of a £50 evoucher TO BE SPLIT BETWEEN THE 8 OF US! It is insulting to say the least!!

"I have been travelling to Sofia/ Bulgaria for over 15 years, this trip was hands down the worst! One young lady at the departure gate was 'shockingly rude' to all the passengers. She obviously liked the sound of her own voice and seemed to delight in loudly insulting people. The flight was delayed for an hour, due to someone throwing up on the walk way. No apology, no effort to resolve the issue, heaven forbid she try to clean the area. Instead she matched around, shouting at one poor guy 'would you like to walk in sick? Because I wouldn't, I wouldn't'  and at another lady 'the luggage allowance is clearly stated, I know because I managed to follow the rules ' perhaps more suited to a bouncer at a pub?

Biggest issue though was a lost bag on the direct flight to Cape Town.  We had two bags almost identical checked in at the same time, both marked priority.  One arrived the other didn’t; lots of consternation as we were cruising.  We received very terse emails to advise what was happening.  Unable to speak to anyone despite trying.

"Sunday 12th January we were travelling on board British Airways flight BA2159 from London Gatwick to Maurice Bishop International Airport, Grenada.

We were due to depart at 10.05 and arriving at 17.05, a scheduled flight of 11 hours, Grenada is four hours behind the UK.

This was not a direct flight there was a scheduled stop at St Lucia before our onward journey to Grenada.

We were travelling in the World Traveller Plus Cabin for additional comfort and space due to the length of the flight.

The information board, in the Departure Lounge advised us to proceed to the gate. Just as we arrived at the the departure gate we received an email, from BA, informing us that departure was delayed until 10.35. There was no information or updates from the ground crew.

The departure Gate 35 was in the satellite section of the airport, it was minus four outside and slightly warmer inside.

Eventually, we commenced boarding at 9.50, which was  completed by 10.10 when the doors closed.

The Captain made an announcement, he apologised for the delay due to the weather conditions. He told us that there was frost on wings, which needed to be sprayed with de-icer before take off. He added that the flight time to St Lucia would be around eight hours and forty-three minutes, a distance of 4,226 miles.

Once de-iced, the aircraft pushed back from the Terminal at 10.43 and we were finally airborne at 11.05, which was an hour later than scheduled 

When we boarded the aircraft, headphones, an amenity kit, pillow and blanket were waiting for us on our seats 

The configuration in the cabin was two, four, two, we had two seats together at the rear of the cabin, we did pay extra for the privilege of selecting our seats.

We were offered a glass of proceco before take off, received with thanks. We were also given the customs and immigration form which need to be completed for presentation on landing. We were also given the dinner/lunch menu, with the following options a starter of ancient grain salad. The main course options were lemon and thyme chicken breast with potatoes, cottage pie with a vegetarian option of mushroom risotto. The dessert was a take on black forest gateau.

Roughly forty minutes into flight offered a drink from the bar, with a small packet of snacks.

About an hour later lunch was served, we both went for the cottage pie option. We were offered a choice of wines to accompany our meals.

Every element of the meal was really good, well impressed. It was followed by a choice of tea or coffee with a Baileys, yes please

The member of the Crew looking after our side of the Cabin, Aleksander, was delightful, he was so attentive and efficient. He looked after us so well and was a major factor in our enjoyment of our flight.

Throughout the flight the crew passed through the cabin with glasses of water and juices. Other drinks were available from the galley.

With about an hour and a quarter before landing in St Lucia we were served a hot pastry, chicken or roast red pepper with a cup of tea or coffee.

We landed  in St Lucia at 15.50 (19.50 UK) so that passengers could disembark and others could join and continue to Grenada. There was also a crew change here. It was not a lengthy process, the doors shut at 16.30 and we were airborne at 16.58.

Before take off we were offered a glass of water or juice.

We were informed that the flight would be about twenty-five minutes, shorter than we thought. There was no service on this sector due to the short nature of the flight 

We landed in Grenada at 17.28, with a thump on a very short runway.  Despite the hour long delay in departure from Gatwick, due to bad weather, we landed twenty-three minutes later than scheduled.

Normally would lower the rating if the flight was delayed, have not done so in this instance as bad weather is not the Airlines fault.

To make matters worse, our luggage, which contained all our business attire and warm coats, was lost. As of today, they still haven't been able to locate it!

It’s hard to understand how they could lose track of luggage traveling from Munich to London. We've tried reaching out via phone and email, but they haven’t responded. Now, my husband is on another British Airways flight to Boston, which is also delayed, and we still have no information about our luggage. It’s been a complete mess, and I’m not sure we will ever choose to fly with BA again 😔",1.0,Munich,London,Europe,January 2025,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
"Not particularly friendly tbh dinner terrible and when we landed we were sprayed .  I’m not happy about this and asked why .  All they said was for bugs .

"I would reccomend Ba to absolutely anyone, simply fantastic, amazing, fabulous. First of all the crew were very friendly. The flight was smooth and so was the landing. After the flight, I was lucky enough to get a visit to see the pilots. They were both very kind people. I received a postcard, logbook and stickers from the pilots. During the flight, complimentary food and drink were given to everyone, on this occasion it was gingerbread men and water- which were both amazing.

"Horrible unprofessional and antagonising check in staff who will not lift a finger to help attach bag labels. Be warned if they refuse to give you their name or employee number, and you film them so you can ID them to the company they will make your life hell and threaten you with not flying etc. They made us delete the film even though we were in arrivals and its open to the public and filming is prohibited in the airport (just not security and departures) They must get commission for how many fees they can issue customers because despite us being allocated 4 bags in the hold, and only checking in 3 which together weighed less than 23kg x3, we were made to move everything around so each bag weighed exactly 23kg or we would be fined $100 per bag. We had no problem checking in the same bags with the same stuff in Gatwick 10 days before. Their reason...policy. However noone could tell me why. After being threatened with not being able to board they called us up again to flight desk to suggest my husband was a threat/ terrorist and unsafe to fly. They surrounded him would not let me through and talked over him without listening to him. The pilot even suggested if he boarded then they would no doubt need to divert the plane to a military base.

"We had a flight from Newcastle -> London -> Delhi with everything arranged, web checkin done and we booked good seats. 
Due to the first flight delay, we did not make the second flight. We were given a flight 7 hours later with separate middle seats, far apart from each other but this had a knock on effect of missing our hotel stay and car and driver that had been arranged in India.
I was going to India for my wedding and missed my wedding dress fitting appointment also.
We were very upset and thought we would get a cup of tea as we both had headaches from the waiting and commotion but the queue at the cafe was so long that we decided to go to the BA lounge to sit down. I was feeling very dizzy and nauseated. My partner said to the receptionist called Av that if he could get the manager while we settle down.
Av asked us for the tickets and then mocked us seeing the ‘economy class’ which was given to us as the only option by BA. I can’t express my disgust at the way he smirked and let out a laugh seeing the tickets. When I confronted him, he asked me for further details which I did provide and added the issues I was facing due to a pounding headache to which his response was “are you going to answer me straight forward or not?”. He threatened to take us off the flight several times if we didn’t move.
We both collapsed on the floor near the door due to being drained of all this and bad head ache.
The manager Caroline Sawyer came and announced straight away that we should get up and leave ignoring our condition. They didn’t ask us once about our health, they didn’t care about spoiling my onward wedding plans which had to be all rearranged, they didn’t care at all about spoiling my start of the beautiful journey for my destination wedding.
Infact she threatened us to call the police and have us removed from the flight again and report at the gate to be monitored.
We left and went for a tea and sandwich. They had given us a voucher of £10 each. The cost of two tea and one sandwich and two packets of crips came to £20.95.
Although we were going to wait 7hours, they didn’t provide us water or any other comfort. 
Because they only have a relationship with virgin Atlantic and air Canada. They would not put us on an afternoon flight on air India even though it was available.
I wish I had not made this mistake of booking BA for my big day plan.
It’s humiliating and embarrassing even to talk to them. They talk to you as if they are God and we are peasants. I think it’s safe to say we had an experience of being with corporate bullies and in easier terms a dictatorship.
Their threats were appalling. Their treatment towards a sick person was deplorable. Their poor attitude added to my stress and caused me more dizziness.

"If I could give negative stars I would. Hands down the worst airline I have ever flown with. British Airways have been responsible for the worst 30 hours of my life. Not only did our flight have massive delays of up to a hour and a half, this was a connecting flight as part of a china southern flight path back to nz. When we asked at the gate they refused to help in any way and wouldn't even let us off the plane first or anything. But It doesn't stop there. Not only did they refuse to help but for reasons that defy logic they then proceeded to cancel the rest of our flight with china southern. We arrived in London with 2 hours to get to our next gate, tight but doable, and being so late at night we flew through security and got there with an hour to spare and boy did we need it, since they had canceled our flight china southern refused us entry to the plane. We had to beg and plead and argue for the next hour just be be able to get on our scheduled flight that BA had supposedly had the authority to cancel. Then again when we got to our next connecting in China. Another 2 hours of arguing with staff because BA had canceled our third leg of the journey as well, with no authorization from us or china southern to do so, asking where our bags were and finally getting new boarding passes china southern assured us both our bags were recorded by BA as being there and would transfer to the plane to chch. Can you guess what happened next. If your guess was our bags were not in Christchurch when we landed you are correct and almost certainly smarter than all of BA staff combined. when we asked china southern staff where our bags were they told us they have no idea. Because of the forced flight changes BA managed to not correctly tag our bags and lose them. 2 days on and we still have no clue where one of our bags are and have only been able to confirm through china southern that they have one, but not which one. When we contacted BA they refused to even help and according to their records we took a completely different flight back. Do yourself a favour and book ryanair instead. At least they own their delays and can man up. BA have managed to avoid all responsibility despite 'helping' to ruin our entire 30+ hour flight plan and refused to do anything about it or even acknowledge it happened. - 5 stars.",1.0,Glasgow,London,Domestic,December 2024,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

When I checked in online 24 hours prior to departure, it showed we were  in the exit row as paid for. I downloaded the PDF boarding pass which clearly showed we were in the exit row.
Yet the boarding passes downloaded in the wallet app on my iPhone showed we were allocated seats in a non exit row?!
When we enquired at the gate about this, showing them the email confirming the purchase of exit row seats, and the PDF boarding pass showing clearly we had exit row seats. There was nothing they could do. We had lots of ‘plastic smiles’ but no one was interested in helping us. Saying ‘it was changed by the system.’
Thankfully on our return flight we did get the exit row seats as pad for.

The Help desk took me to the right location to then see its actually closed as a normal procedure every day and open in the next 5hours.

They did a longer search to find out i am meant to be on it but (BRITISH AIRWAYS DIDNT INFORM JETSTAR) so they let me on a later flight instead of my orignal one.

"I’m a frequent flyer with British Airways, mainly because it offers the fastest and most convenient connection for me when traveling from Europe to Nashville. With no good direct flight options, BA through London remains my best choice. It typically takes me about 12-14 hours from major European cities to Nashville, which is reasonable. The crew is always pleasant, and the service on board has been consistently good.

That being said, I’m only giving 3 stars, and here’s why: while the route is convenient, the state of the aircraft leaves much to be desired. BA alternates between two types of planes for this route—mostly older Boeing 787 Dreamliners. Unfortunately, this doesn’t inspire confidence, as I frequently experience issues during flights, mainly with the seats and onboard equipment.

The seats are uncomfortable and often in poor condition. I’ve had broken armrests, and once, a piece of plastic came off, exposing the internal wiring of the USB socket and seat mechanisms. Speaking of USB sockets, they are often worn out or broken, so I always bring fully charged power banks. Additionally, the in-flight entertainment system has failed multiple times, and on one occasion, even the announcement system stopped working. The crew explained they had to hard reset the system and were seeking help from engineers in London. This incident left me wondering how well these aging planes could handle more serious technical issues.

Despite these drawbacks, I continue flying with BA because there are currently no better alternatives. However, I’ve heard rumors that new airlines might soon introduce flights from Europe to Nashville. If that happens, I’ll likely switch, even though I’ve already achieved Silver Member status with BA.

In summary, British Airways offers a convenient connection and friendly service, but the aging aircraft and persistent technical issues make for a less-than-ideal experience.",3.0,London,Nashville,International,December 2024,4.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0
"We travelled with British Airways from Toulouse Airport to Heathrow on the 4th January.  The experience was awful. 

Check in opened with three desks. One for Euro Traveller, One for Bag Drop and One for World Traveller. Assuming that we could drop our bags without any fuss, we checked in online and printed out our baggage labels at the airport. 

We joined the queue for the bag drop which quickly became a long queue behind us. The couple in front of us had a problem with their luggage which took over 30 minutes to resolve due to the management of the problem by the check in person who spent the whole time on the telephone or interrupting the check in person on the next desk to ask questions.

I understand that people can have problems with baggage but when there were over 50 people waiting just to drop their luggage, having tagged them previously, it is unacceptablle to keep the whole line waiting. It would have been a better experience for all travellers in the bag drop queue if the check in person had asked the couple with the problem to stand to one side until the line had been cleared. By delaying everyone due to the problem with their luggage we had no time to get food or have a drink before we boarded. This was essential as British Airways had already informed us that there would be no food or drink service on the flight due to a faulty chiller.

"My husband and I flew to Doha on 20th November, 2024.  The return flight on 4th December at 07:15 (BA122) was cancelled and we were put on the 01:45 (BA126).  We had to extend our hotel room then hang around in the hotel lounge and at Hamad airport.  At Heathrow it was a diy bag drop.  All people were having problems and calling for the attention from 2 members of staff.  I do not want to security tag the bags myself.  There was no instructions and I am not trained.  (What a 2nd rate airline.  Not passenger friendly.)  The diy attached label had come off one of the suitcases.  I do not know how the suitcase managed to end up on the conveyor belt in Doha!

We flew Premium Economy.  On the return flight, the person in front of me put his seat so far back, it knocked off my small bottle of wine and I could not focus any more on the tv screen .  (I am always mindful of the person behind me and do not recline my seat much.)  I stood up and asked him to put the seat up, as did my husband.  2 stewards came and told me to be quiet and sit down.  No more watching the screen.

The seat headrest was loose and fell off.   My head was between 2 metal prongs.  My husband and I tried to get the headrest back on but could not.  Staff walked by but not one came to offer assistance.  On landing, I sat holding the pillow behind my head, fearing my head could be impaled on one of the metal prongs.

We had to leave it until the airport and got there with more time to spare and the difference was night & day.

"On November 26, 2023, my son and I traveled via the Underground to Heathrow Airport for our return flight home to San Diego after a wonderful visit to London and Dublin.  However, we were unaware that the Underground was not serving Terminal 5 that day.  We ended up at Terminal 2, where we were directed to take a bus to Terminal 5; however, the bus was not there.  Instead, we took a taxi.  When we arrived, we were not allowed to proceed to the gate, despite not having any checked baggage.  The employee stated that it was too late, that we were not the only passengers affected by the lack of Underground service and bus service, and that British Airways had re-booked the other displaced passengers at NO charge on another flight.  However, when Josephine and George (British Airways employees) tried to call British Airways customer service via their internal line, they were placed on hold for over an hour!  They tried calling with three different phones with the same result!  I myself called using another number I found online but was told I needed to call the same customer service number.  Finally, Josephine reached a live person, only to be told that my son and I would have to pay £4,000 for two tickets to San Diego!  Hello, what??!!?!  £4,000???  The other passengers in the same situation as we were had been re-booked at NO charge! Why were we being treated differently?  This is disparate treatment and discrimination on the part of British Airways.  Other passengers who missed their flight due to lack of Underground service were NOT being charged to take another flight, but we had to pay? It was clear that Josephine (bless her heart for trying) was just as confused and angry as we were.

Frustrated and despondent, my son and I approached another British Airways employee, Miguel.  Miguel also tried to re-book us at no charge but was denied.  Since it seemed the only way we were going to get home was to buy a brand new, duplicate ticket, Miguel advised that we book round-trip tickets as they were cheaper than one-way tickets.  

Because of the disparate treatment, inequality, and discrimination on your part, my son and I were forced to purchase another airline ticket for the next day, Monday, 11/27/23 to Phoenix, AZ and then connecting to San Diego, CA.  In addition, we had to stay overnight in a hotel only to come back to the airport the next morning to take the new flight, which by the way, was delayed about two hours, causing us to just barely catch our connecting flight from Phoenix, AZ to San Diego, CA.  We also incurred costs for transportation, meals and foreign transaction fees as a result of this unequal treatment.  My total refund / reimbursement request is $2,416.64.  I opened a case with BA but this took months and my request was denied despite all my efforts going back to them and calling.  I opened a case with Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution CEDR as suggested by BA.  This also took months and was denied.  Neither BA nor CEDR ever acknowledged that BA had acted in a discriminatory manner towards my son and me.

"First time on BA First.  I have experienced BA in business and economy before.
First, is first for a reason I suppose.  The care and personality of attendants were superb.  I didn't get both their names, I think one was Hana, and I didn't even think to look up the other's tag or ask her name.  But I was quite sick from my almost gone flu but they noticed I was sick, and was extra kind asking me if I needed more tea to sooth my coughing.  This season's flu is no fun.  They provided with hot tea, throughout the flight.  
There were a few others to relieve the two, and I don't recall how many but at least two members.  Both were also very helpful and kind.
They all were asking me if I needed something, before I even thought about asking, but the hot tea and the honey, and sometimes snacks were helpful in making my trip much more comfortable, than I was worried I would have to endure.

The seats are well designed, with full recline.  The screen is a extra large (bigger than business).  Selection of movies and music were very good.  The headphones comfortable, not sure if they were noise cancelling, but drowned out the noise very well.   The various storage compartments were nice.  Hanging closet, foot locker (two), arm locker, and head locker. Every odd stuff I had tucked in nicely for easy access.

Food selections were good, and were very enjoyable.  The 'Afternoon Tea' service was very good, and again the tea helped me a lot.  They gave me a whole teapot full of English Tea.

Noticing my need for for liquids, they also gave me new bottles as I finished them off again before asking.

If I have a chance to fly first again, I would do it again.

I thought BA's business was pretty good, but they go extra on first.  

First class, you get your own check in area, followed by security line, and your own special lounge area.  I was there without breakfast quite early, but they basically have a restaurant that serves you a full menu breakfast of choice.
I had a Full English Breakfast, and sausage, bacon were first class, and eggs were done perfectly.  The potatoes, and beans were done nicely too.  I had black coffee that was brewed perfectly, and i liked the flavor of their default blend.  I was glad I skipped breakfast at the hotel, and had it in the lounge instead.

The lounge area have living room type seating, that were comfortable enough to make you sleepy, and enough to go around for everyone and still be someone private, if one desired to be left alone, and also, a more busy bar, and sitting area section where you could be more interactive.

"Shockingly Disappointing Experience with a Once Renowned Airline

I was downgraded without any prior warning and only informed at the gate—an incredibly unprofessional and frustrating experience. This is not the level of service I expected from an airline that used to pride itself on excellence.

Compared to other airlines, the food quality is poor, and you get significantly less space, making long-haul flights uncomfortable and far from worth the cost.

What’s worse is their clear disregard for customer care and loyalty. Since the pandemic, this airline seems to have lost its way, laying off staff recklessly and overbooking flights—all while reducing the quality of their services.

"I have had a good experience with BA previously, and the recent travel to Marrakech was not as pleasant as expected. 
On the return flight, we were seated in row 36 - towards the back of the plane, there was a mix of pleasant staff and rude staff. Two of the staff were rude, and their service to other passengers, including ourselves, was appalling. Now, we had to buy everything except water. When asked for water on a 3hr 40-minute flight, it was not accepted cordially and was delayed by these 2 staff. My son got so upset that he ended up buying 2 bottles of water, as he was not happy with the attitude of the staff. When we were buying the coffee ( which was bad anyway ) the flight steward was impatient and did not even wait for me to complete my order and was happy to go away with my coffee order only. I had to call him back and complete the order for drinks and coffee for myself and the kids. I could not help but advice the steward that he was being extremely rude and not valuing us as passengers. He did apologise after a bit of defensive arguments, which was accepted. The other air hostess was banging the food trolley on the aisle seats and did not even say sorry for her behaviour. While she was serving the drinks and passengers were waiting behind her to go to the toilet, she opened the overhead baggage storage and banged it so hard - twice, that it opened up again and another passenger, had to gently shut the overhead baggage storage, which remained shut. Sania the other air hostess, was extremely polite and was talking and attending to the passengers with a smile on her face.  
A smile costs nothing !!
We paid £600 + for each ticket, and perhaps the budget airlines would have been a better deal on these so-called ' short-haul flights '.... 3 hrs 40 minute flight ??

"My recent experience with British Airways was an absolute disaster. From start to finish, their incompetence, lack of professionalism, and complete disregard for their customers made for one of the most frustrating travel experiences I have ever endured.

It began at London City Airport, where I was pressured into checking in my carry-on bag despite my reluctance. I was assured that “everything would be handled.” Instead, this decision turned my holiday into a nightmare. Upon arriving at Palma de Mallorca airport, my bag was nowhere to be found. To make matters worse, there was no British Airways representative at the airport to assist. I was handed a phone number for a call centre, which only added to the frustration.

The call centre staff informed me that I would receive an update within 48 hours - an absurd timeframe considering my holiday was only three days long. I was left without clothes or essential toiletries, which completely ruined the trip. Although I was told I could claim reimbursement for these expenses, the stress and inconvenience were unbearable.

To make matters worse, I have been forced to coordinate between British Airways, another airline, PMI Airport, and London City Airport to try to locate my bag, as nobody seems to know where it is. British Airways eventually claimed the bag never left London City due to an apparent tagging error. However, they have since admitted that they cannot locate the bag and it is officially lost. Despite this, they continue to say they cannot declare it lost until 21 days have passed—an utterly ridiculous policy when it is clear they have no idea where the bag is.

I have incurred international call charges trying to resolve the issue, wasting hours of my holiday speaking to different representatives who all gave conflicting information. The lack of coordination and accountability is appalling.

The call centre staff were unhelpful, unable to escalate my concerns or connect me with anyone who could provide meaningful assistance. Representatives hung up on me or promised to call back but never did. When I attempted to lodge a formal complaint, I was told the only way to do so was via an online form. After submitting my claim, I received no response or explanation, and it was not until I called that the call centre rep and I both learned at the same time that my claim had been closed without any reasoning.

This ordeal consumed my entire holiday, leaving me stressed, frustrated, and stranded without basic necessities. British Airways’ inability to perform such a fundamental task as baggage handling, compounded by their refusal to take responsibility or provide any meaningful support, is utterly disgraceful.

I would strongly advise anyone considering flying with British Airways to think twice. Their disorganisation, lack of accountability, and complete disregard for customer care make them an appalling choice for travel.

British Airways in flight service and lounges always impress. The airport staff are also always helpful and pleasant. That’s where the good experience ends. Their online/phone customer service and overall operations are completely awful. Walking down steps in a modern airport to board an aircraft in the rain via airstairs while there is a perfectly serviceable jet bridge right next to the aircraft simply boggles the mind.

"Third flight of the year with BA, third out of three to disappoint. I went for Premium Economy after having been let down by a previous Business Class flight. I had paid extra to get an assigned seat and was not near the back of the cabin. As had occured previously in Business Class they ran out of my meal choice (Roast Chicken breast) and, because every other remaining choice contained aliums (onions or garlic) as did the remaining meals in Business Class, I got a plate of fruit for my tranatlantic flight. Even the snacks had chives. The national airline can provide a special Indian Jain meal however I'm not vegetarian nor keen on Indian cuisine.

"My journey began on a nightmarish note when I arrived at the airport to discover that my flight to Edinburgh (RAS5HJ) had been cancelled. The situation quickly became frustrating as I approached British Airways staff for assistance, only to be sent from one person to another without receiving any real help. 

At around 5:10 AM, I was handed a customer service card, but the office didn’t open until 8 AM. The only alternative offered was a flight from Belfast, which meant I would have to wait all day for my final leg to Edinburgh. This left me feeling incredibly distressed and helpless.

However, my experience took a turn for the better when I reached the G section in Terminal 5 at Heathrow. There, I met Sony Khuttan, who was not only extremely helpful but also genuinely empathetic. He took the time to listen to my concerns and helped me book an alternative flight directly to Edinburgh. 

I wish British Airways had more staff like Sony who are dedicated to their jobs and truly care about their customers, rather than just pushing them from one section to another.

"I was thirsty. 
My crew cabin light had been on for 30 mins - no response. If I was having a fit/emergency whilst my seat partners were asleep....
When I eventually got up and went to the back for water, no one in the kitchen, i found 2 membwrs of cabin crew sleeping behind the crew curtains. I politely asked for some water, they said to ask colleagues 'out there' I said 'there is no one out here'. The lady responded they will have water in their trolleys.'  The colleagues referred to were actually in the premium cabin so I hadn't seen them earlier.
I made my way to one of them to ask for a glass of water. I downed it and  requested a second.  He reluctantly served it and said 'Ma'am you should have waited in your seat.' I responded my crew cabin light has been on for only half an hour' and he just sniggered. Why should anyone have to wait 40 minutes for a glass of water on a flight? I stopped flying BA on the Lagos - London route because I witnessed cabin crew member repeatedly yell at a very elderly man who needed the toilet when the lights for the seat belts came on. He may have had issues with incontinence -  no compassion. 19 years later no adjustment or evolution of your values or standards of customer care on that route.  Not one of them cracked a smile whilst serving as if we were a burden!

"To provide context, I have been a regular traveller around the world for well over 30 years on business and have used many different airlines.  I was a BA gold card holder for over 15 years until I recently retired and held several frequent flyer cards with other airlines, so I can remember the days, long ago, when BA was one of the world’s leading airlines.  The airline business has become more competitive at the lower, cheaper end of the scale leading to reduced space and comfort for economy class travel and BA is no exception to this change.

I recently travelled BA from Sharm El Sheikh Airport, Egypt to London Gatwick business class and the level of service was extremely poor as was the quality of the seating for the price paid.  Seats were economy standard with the middle seat left free.  They were hard, uncomfortable and did not recline properly which, for a five and a half hour flight is unacceptable when paying a substantially increased cost for what should be a much higher level of comfort.  The cabin staff were surly to the point of rudeness and generally unhelpful on this particular flight; they did not pay any attention to business class passengers.  At one point, when we needed a blanket because of a cold draught entering the cabin by the exit door, we had to go to the back of business class seating area where the cabin crew were seated and chatting to each other, totally indifferent to our needs.  They only had four blankets for the flight, all of which had been used.  This poor level of service and discomfort is not what one should expect in business class on any BA flight.

This five and a half hour flight was operated as a European service which, frankly, is stretching geographical limits to the extreme as we flew over part of Africa before crossing the Sinai Peninsula which it in Asia.  I note that EgyptAir use proper business class seats on their London-Cairo route, which I shall use if I travel to Egypt again.  

A week later I travelled economy class return from London to Nice.  The seats were basically the same although this did not bother me as the ticket price was competitively priced and it was only a short flight.  Cabin crew were excellent, helpful and attentive both ways; the flight crew provided useful information on flight progress and we left Heathrow on time.

Why the huge disparity of service from cabin crew (and comfort) between an expensive business class flight from Gatwick to Sharm El Sheikh and an economy class flight to Nice?

- Receiving an email on the day before that they rebooked us on another flight - when other flights kept operating the same route on the same day. We called to change the rebooking, ended up in different airport + worse time. We applied for a refund 2 weeks ago and received no receipt notification, no communication.

- 'Forfeiting' of return flight after missing outbound flight. We were not advised, and in fact received a 'get you ready for your flight' email. We only found out from condescending customer service staff on the phone that 'the rules are clearly stated in the terms and conditions'. 

- Multiple issues with booking codes, making it impossible to check-in online. Have been talking to Customer Service on an off for 90mn now just to check-in online and select a seat.

"British Airways a National Disgrace!
This airline should not be allowed you use the name British, they are a total embarrassment to the nation as a whole. 
They simply cannot be considered a top tier airline and should be viewed as a Budget Airline relying on reputation to bump up their ticket price. 
On a recent flight from Cyprus BA621 on 23/11/24, the second the cabin door was closed the pilot announced we would be held on the runway for 2 hours. They know this prior and did not inform passengers until after we had boarded.
The flight home took nearly 6 hours due to weather conditions, this plus 2 hours waiting. What did BA offer during this 8 hour hell flight…3 oatmeal biscuits and 250ml of water for our family.
When I went to the cabin crew to ask for more water, which I was told there wasn’t any 3 out of the 4 cabin crew were fast asleep in the back row seats of the aircraft BA621 on 23/11/24. This infuriated me further as I had previously asked if there were any spare seats so that my 2 year old could spread out and get some sleep if available. I was told the flight was full.
Apparently, the sleep and comfort of Cabin Crew is more important than paying passengers.
After we arrived late my connecting flight had now been missed. We then queued at the connections desk in a large queue only to watch the BA staff ‘clock off’ for the night in front of us.
No genuine support was given to me, or my family and we were effectively abandoned by BA.
I’ve tried to speak to someone, but their ‘helpline’ has an automated message saying due to the number of calls (not surprised by that aspect) they cant assist me, then hang up. Tried this several times at various times. I think it’s their default message.

Awful customer service yet again - I have just spent an hour on the phone to a rude & unhelpful “assistant” who kept putting me on hold every 2 minutes whilst trying to make a simple flight change, after being told it could only be done over the phone, only to be accused of being a fraudster and consequently not being able to change our flights. The only option now is to book new flights & spend money we don’t have right before Christmas. Absolutely disgusting - will not be flying with them again and will do my upmost to make sure friends and family also avoid travelling with them as time and time again they cause distress & upset",1.0,Miami,London,International,December 2024,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

"I arrived on 9/12   about 3 pm at Larnaca airport   and my boarding pass did not open the gate. It was 4 hours  20 minutes before the flight.  Staff speaking between them made me understand the flight was cancelled so they told me to speak with BA staff.  The lady told me that flight is cancelled and that BA will take care of hotel overnight and a new flight, As I asked her to book a hotel for me she refused telling me all the passengers must arrive first. I told her I am on my own, still refused to book me a hotel, she told me wait another 3 hours. As I checked on line I have seen another flight in 40 minutes to Gatwick and asked her if I can take this flight as I was sure I will have to pay for my hotel and problems getting compensations from BA as written in many cases on Trip advisor. The lady accepted to help me, spoke by phone and arranged for me to get the flight to Gatwick instead, arriving safely by 7 pm in Gatwick airport. So happy ending. About 4 pm I got an email from BA telling me that my flight  to Heathrow it was delayed and they do not now more details which was a joke as I had already a new flight. The flight to Gatwick was OK, kind and caring staff . No free food or free drinks on a 4 hours 45 minutes...just a small pack of biscuits and a glass of water, so I purchased on flight what I needed. I was not given the reason why my flight was cancelled.....BA is a budget airline , it has changed a lot.",3.0,Larnaca,London,Europe,December 2024,3.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,1.0

"This review is written with great sadness.   I bought tickets to fly to Buenos Aires  from Manchester.  My travelling companion is an elderly man with health issues and BA had agreed that he was in need to special assistance. The day we were due to fly I gt a message from BA  saying our flight might be delayed due to bad weather.  I range them and  asked if we could travel directly under our own arrangements to LHR.  This was refused.  BA  have signed  up to what I understand is an airline wide agreement that if a person doesnt use the first leg of their ticket  the whole ticket is voided.  Prophetically I pointed out this might cost them a lot more  money.

In fact when we got to Manchester  the air was totally calm  this was  about 5 hours before we were due to fly.   Leaving aside  the indignities with BA  ground staff (  London  staff are so different)  we were informed in the departure lounges 3 hours delay so the flight to Buenis Aires was already missed. Now you might have thought that they would immediately put other ways of travelling in place but NO.  I believe at the time  it would have been possible to have got us on a flight the next morning  via madrid.

We boarded the plane.   After about 45 minutes we were thrown off. Despite  assurances from the crew there was NO ONE from BA  to  advise us .  This was now midnight.

I got a message from BA saying they had booked ME on a flight form LHT in 2  days no mention of my companion  who was  advised to check manage my booking which only said  the flight to LHR was cancelled.   And no mention how i was supposed to get to LHR

I was given a phone number to ring but when I did it said we closed at 8 p.m. what bad service that was.

Now when we got to London under our own steam  we got some good help in the first class lounge.  I will be fair about that.   We got to Buenos Aires 2 days late which partly ruined the trip- we were there to play for England seniors in a bridge world championship.   We had to pay from our own pockets  for missed hotel  bookings.

Since then I have to say the BA  support has been a total shambles.  First they said the  delay then cancellation was due to weather and beyond their control. Then it was a bird strike   and now once again its weather.  

The fact is IF  it was weather  they have to prove it was impossible to deliver a flight and thats clearly NOT  the case. THEY made managerial  decisions   which flights to service and which not.  They cannot prove it was impossible  but they are doing anything they can  to  resist compensation.

They have refused to address my complaints about poor customer service.  

 They paid my travelling companion compensation  for not using the flight to LHR  but although  we were never apart  they say I did use it!!  They also say I travelled to Venice and now they refuse to answer me on these false statements.

Why would anyone want to travel with this airline again  I will not thats for sure.  Naturally they read the reviews.  I challenge them to give an intellectually an morally  robust response.  I will not hold my breath",1.0,Manchester,Buenos Aires,International,October 2024,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
"Shoutout to British Airways—no joke, y’all are the GOAT of the skies. Like, I wasn’t just flying; I was vibing at 30,000 feet.

First off, the crew? Absolute legends. They weren’t just handing out snacks; they were serving smiles and vibes. I legit felt like royalty, and I was in economy—so imagine what first class must be like. Probably sipping tea with the Queen (RIP) up there.

The plane? Smooth like butter. I swear the pilot must’ve trained with Formula 1 or something ‘cause we hit that runway like pros. No turbulence drama either—thank you for not turning my stomach into a rollercoaster.

Oh, and the food? BA said, “Who said plane food has to suck?” It wasn’t just edible; it was downright tasty. Like, I caught myself looking forward to the meal service—WHO AM I?

In-flight entertainment? Absolutely stacked. Movies, shows, music—y’all turned a long-haul flight into a Netflix binge sesh. I was so entertained I forgot I was crammed in a metal tube hurtling through the air.

To sum it up: British Airways, you guys are the MVPs of the skies. 10/10 would fly again. If flying with y’all was a sport, I’d be your #1 fan in the front row with a foam finger.",5.0,London,Los Angeles,International,December 2024,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
"I am so disappointed with BA.  Their customer service department do their best, but they have no authority anymore.  Their customer Relations dept., is an absolute joke!! There is no relationship between them and the customer. You cannot phone them, you cannot email them, and it appears they can owe you thousands for a cancelled flight and 3 months later, when you’re struggling near Christmas, they won’t process your claim. I have been lied to, let down, and stranded with no help.  What happened to The British Airways of old?  They literally don’t give a c*^p about the people that pay their bills, not one hoot.

If you can, use any other airline.  Even when your flight isn’t cancelled, there aren’t enough staff or meals and they ‘forget’ to empty the sewage tanks on the ground, so for an 8 hour flight there was only one toilet for the whole upper deck.

Disgusting. Shareholders matter more to this corporation, not the customers that actually make the company.",1.0,Tampa,London,International,September 2024,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
"Based on my experience on BA 185 on 12/09/24, BA is the worst airline in Europe.  In my opinion, the plane was dirty, decrepit and should not have been flying. The flight attendants ignored the  passengers and allowed old food and garbage to pile up in the cabin trays and aisles.  Worst of all, BA left half of the passengers with NO luggage at the EWR destination. The BA luggage attendants left the passengers waiting at the carousel and sauntered over after 15 minutes with insulting and condescending remarks.  They assured us that BA would call us the next day with information about our baggage delivery.  No one has called me since we landed on 12/9/24 but I have made 12 calls to BA in  which I have been given misinformation and told outright lies.  This morning I was told my luggage would be delivered to my home at 2PM.  Tonight, after no luggage arrived by 9:10pm, I called BA and was told the BA computer system could not even determine whether my luggage had even left Heathrow.   When I asked what was going on and why BA was lying, the customer service rep apologized but acknowledged that BA has no idea where my luggage is right now.  The BA luggage portal does not work or update.  My frustration with BA is at an all time high.    I urge anyone considering BA as a carrier to forget the idea immediately.

"Flight itself was nice. For whatever reason our baggage was not loaded onto the aircraft. About 40 people were waiting at the luggage carousel for their luggage upon arriving in Aberdeen. After waiting there like idiots for 20 minutes, BA sent us an email informing us that our bags had not been loaded onto the flight due to ‘operational challenges’.

Now, I can understand that the odd bag goes missing every now and then, but for more or less everyone on the flights bag to simply not be loaded is ridiculous. What makes matters worse is that the Captain and all crew would have known about this, and instead of doing the decent thing and making an announcement explaining what had happened, they remained silent (they did mention something about paperwork in the pre flight briefing - I bet it was a form stating that no baggage would be travelling on this service.) They let us believe that upon arrival we could expect our baggage. Alas, there was none! For me the frustrating thing is not so much about losing the bag, more about the attitude and lack of communication for both the company and crew on this day. Disappointed is not the word. And to make matters worse, I’m still waiting for my baggage 34 hours later. A disgrace.",1.0,London,Aberdeen,Domestic,December 2024,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

"I’ve had a very disappointing experience with this company and can no longer recommend them. This is the third time in a year my flights have been canceled, and I’ve decided it’s the last.

Flight cancellations are sometimes unavoidable—that’s not the issue. The real problem is how British Airways handles them. In my experience, their customer service has been unhelpful and unwilling to address the situation in a way that meets expectations. They’ve made rebooking extremely difficult, and their processes feel more focused on minimizing their obligations than assisting passengers.

For instance, when a flight is canceled last-minute, other airlines I’ve flown with, like KLM and EasyJet, have been proactive and accommodating. Unfortunately, I’ve found that BA falls short by comparison.

This has been frustrating enough that I’ve decided to avoid flying with them in the future. If you’re considering your options, I’d suggest looking elsewhere.",1.0,London,Inverness,Domestic,December 2024,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
"Flew LHR to MAD (return) in Euro Traveller, flying out on an A320 (BA468) and back on the A321 NEO (BA467).  Both flights boarded well, without any issue.  The return flight form MAD was bus from gate to plane and we had a delay due to the traffic control at both ends.

Flight was comfortable, we had a spare centre seat on both flights, which was a positive.

Air crew were good, friendly and approachable.  Snack and drink issued on both flights.

Flight over just two hours, so you cannot complain.

Madrid airport is huge, it was the first time I had caught a flight direct from MAD, having transferred many times.  The flight comes in and leaves from T4S and it takes a good while from the train station to the gate, with a lot of walking and a train trip.

MAD worked efficiently though, through security and clear signage.  LHR could again learn a thing or two.  How come we are still having to remove liquids at our supposedly Capital Airport??",4.0,London,Madrid,Europe,December 2024,4.0,4.0,N/A,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0
"We have travelled on BA business class on a few recent flights and I was becoming to think they had lost the plot. However to my surprise, we got a cost effective upgrade from Business to First for $200 each. 

The experience was certainly something to consider in the future. With only 8 seats in First, more staff to passengers in this class. Super attentive and if you wanted space you got that too. 

The food was on the next level, comparible with fine dining restaurants in London, with a wine list to compliment the food.

I understand that passengers who are not white and fly economy class like me are just annoying. He probably thought I  didn't deserve any service, and did it. I would not get such if I am white.

Being a gold member if British Airways I want to advise you of the following... NEVER NEVER NEVER USE them. Fight cancellation has recently affected me and I had next morning to perform an operation in Athens to a baby that had a blinding condition. Every time that there is bad weather a flight to Athens is always cancelled. Not only they did not put me on the next flight to Athens although I explained to them the urgency but they sent me through Frankfurt and I arrived in Athens after midnight. I had specialised instruments in the checked bag and the bag did not arrive. As a result we had to cancel the operation. Can not explain the amount of phonecalls I went through to try to solve all this and after having spent several hours there is no resolution.

"I've been flying with BA for a long time now, and in my opinion the service just gets worse the longer time goes on. This time we were sat on the Tarmac for over 3 hours before we took off. The reason was down to a fuel gauge failure. I understand these things do happen, and working in the field that I do I also know who is responsible. 

BA played there old tricks, we took off, and the pilot was obviously instructed to try and make up some time to decrease the chance of them having to pay out compensation. I spoke to BA about the 3+ hour delay, and they insisted that as they made up time on route the 3 hour window did not count. 

Typical BA, there were no people on the check in, the check in online app was down, there were only half of the meals that were on the menu actually on the plane, so it was eat the one option or nothing. Just embarrassing really. 
The flight back a week later was the same, no meals, and a really rude male attendant.

BA has the narrowest seat in the industry, but a better seat pitch at 30 inch. 
Its about 40% more expensive for a basic free cabin bag than easyJet and Wizz Air but the extra legroom seat upgrade is essential to me, and that costs around £40-50 for a return on Wizzair and easyJet.

"My experience with British Airways was an absolute disgrace from start to finish, and I cannot stress enough how appalling this airline's service is. First, my flight was delayed by an hour without any proper explanation or apology—just a vague announcement that did nothing to address the inconvenience caused to passengers who had planned their day around their original schedule. As if that wasn’t enough, I discovered that my seat was double-booked, leading to an embarrassing and chaotic confrontation at the gate. How on earth does a supposedly reputable airline fail to manage basic seat assignments? It’s sheer incompetence!

The final insult came from the staff, who were not only dismissive and unhelpful but outright rude. Instead of resolving the issues or offering some semblance of professionalism, they treated passengers with disdain, making us feel like we were an inconvenience to them. The complete lack of accountability, courtesy, or even basic customer service skills from this airline is utterly shocking.

British Airways markets itself as a premium airline, but my experience was worse than budget carriers. I cannot overstate how infuriating and disappointing this was.

"We made the decision to change our British Airways flight from London to Valenica due to the flooding in Valenica and go from London to Madrid instead. We discovered that our original BA flight to Valencia was non-refundable other than the government taxes. BA then slugged us another 700 pounds for a new flight to Madrid. Ok well I guess we purchased non-refundable tickets so that’s on us, but so much for loyalty. The security at Heathrow T5 was very slow and to the point where my wife felt the body search, she was subjected to was inappropriate bordering on criminal behaviour by the security personnel.  The Boarding of the Madrid flight was chaotic with 9 boarding zones for a A320 aircraft?  The cabin crew were finding it difficult to stow hand luggage and then announcing over the PA threatening to delay the flight if all hand luggage could not be stowed. This was our 8th flight in the last two weeks and the most chaotic boarding by far.  Ok so we can settle in after taking off and have a much-needed cuppa. WRONG! this British airline, you know from Britain, where the whole British Empire was built on a cup of tea? Just handed out water, and if you wanted a cuppa you would need to pay for it! We could not believe it! Every other full-service offered us free hot drinks and Air France on a short flight even gave us free sandwiches.  BA also handed out a small packet of 'Love Corn' this stuff was disgusting, not food for humans, maybe good for chickens.

"BA had always been the go-to airline for comfort and security. You pay the higher price to guarantee you get your seat and you get to your destination on time. Well, this trip I was tricked into buying an extra ticket.
I had booked my flight online for myself and my girlfriend and paid using PayPal. There was some sort of error in this but I was charged nonetheless. When we eventually got to the airport, ready to check in, we found that for some reason, my girlfriend was unable to check in her details. When we went to a staff member for assistance, they seemed to understand, asking how I paid - I explained through PayPal and they said 'ah, another one'. This gave me hope, thinking that others had gone through the same difficulty, but when we got to the counter, the man there said I would effectively have to purchase my girlfriend's tickets again. He explained that I would be refunded the total within three days and it was just to show the system that the purchase was made. So, like an idiot, afraid we wouldn't be able to travel, I paid the fee again... And I waited 3 days, then ten, then three weeks as many others had. Nothing was refunded.
When I wrote a message to BA's help service, where I provided the detailed story and receipts, I waited another month to get a single line response from some random employee, possibly automated message, that said sorry but we disagree.
To say I was annoyed is an understatement. 
The fact that I had gone out of my way to fly with BA only to have them effectively spit in my face and steal more of my cash is a deep betrayal of trust and I won't be flying with them again. Not to mention, the return flight was delayed, rushed and overall unfriendly from all staff members, making me realise that even the original total I paid was far from worth it.

"My wife and I have travelled economy plus with other carriers. In comparison the BA service falls well short in terms of its cabin service.

Seats are  comfortable, the facilities and handouts (such as headphones and blankets ) good.

Drinks were virtually non existent. A glass of water / juice about 1/2 hour into the flight. No tea or coffee after the meal.

"My wife and I flew from Heathrow to Gibraltar for an 8-day holiday, checking in two large bags.  On arrival in Gibraltar we were told our bags had been left behind at Heathrow (together it seems with those of many of the other passengers on the plane based in the scrummage of people seeking details of what was going to happen).  We registered details and were told the bags would follow within a couple of days.  In fact the bags weren’t handed back to us until we arrived at Gibraltar Airport for the return flight.  Faced with an 8-day holiday with zero luggage, we spent money on a reasonable minimum of clothing, phone chargers, toiletries, medications and other essentials at a cost of some £670.  On return, we put in a claim of British Airways, to which (4 months on) they have never replied.  I complained about this delay: they provided a £100 voucher for a future flight, but still no reply to my original claim.  We are thus significantly out of pocket at the hands of British Airways and (reluctantly) claiming on our insurance.  It was sad that so many passengers were affected, including two young girls who were crying at Gibraltar Airport because they had no money to buy replacement clothes.  
I wrote to the CEO of British Airways raising a number of issues, most importantly why the plane took off without a large number of bags (a figure of 80 bags was mentioned by airport staff on arrival) and why we weren’t told of this prior to take-off and given a chance leave the aircraft (which we’d have preferred to a ruined holiday).

I am literally on my flight now, from London Gatwick to Punta Cana, in Premium Economy.

BA has officially lost it. These seats are so uncomfortable I can't belive it. The foam is cheap and I can feel the seat structure through the cushion. I am sat on a blanket to make it a bit more comfortable. They started going downhill before covid, when they began charging for food and seat selections.

They also, in recent years, have chosen quantity ovrt quality by adding additional seats to rows making it less comfort.

If you're going to position yourself as a cheaper airline, lower your damn prices. This is an absolute joke.

I have another long haul flight booked with BA in 3 months, again, in Premium. Economy (Club World). I tried to cancel so I could fly with another airline but they'd only refund me the taxes.

British Airways is a pack of filthy liars.

The gate agent said they couldn't give us a refund, which was fine with us since it was last minute,  but at least our traveling companions who were still going on the plane could have a little extra room.

Used their claims page and all was OK. It was from there that it became incomprehensibly frustrating. My case was closed but to confirmation of what the conclusion was or any money.

"Came back from Atlanta last night. Mixed experience when it should be excellent.
The good - excellent service on board and the newer layout of the Business class seats is good with plenty of storage around the individual area. Seat was comfortable and lie flat very spacious making sleeping a good experience.

The bad - it erks me that once you've booked business you then have to pay over £100 to book a seat prior to the free window opening. This is new this year and not a smart move as I was a loyal BA customer and that loyalty is being worn down with this penny pinching.

It was an evening flight home. I'm vegetarian and there is always one vegetarian option on the menu. Some bright spark has decided that the evening menus are a) reduced and B) astoundingly don't have a vegetarian option.

It was only the attentive service of the crew that got me something from 1st (I think). Breakfast was terrible so not a great experience. I wouldn't have minded if the lounge at Atlanta was great but it's not, just adequate.

Also the movie I watched kept glitching, even after a reset which topped off the pre sleep but if the flight, not in a good way.

Checked the baggage allowance prior to booking and the website states: one cabin baggage and small hand luggage is allowed for economy travellers. So i thought I take my tiny backpack that is barely big enough for a 500ml bottle of water and my smaller than cabin sized hard cased bag.
First, both of the flights were delayed. 
Second, I was asked to check my cabin bag in (even though this left me essentially with nothing). I asked the flight attendant whether I could please take it as we will arrive to Budapest close to midnight and my surgery is the next day- if they lose that luggage, I cannot have my operation. She kindly let me keep the luggage (just because she was an angel), but I was shocked.
Checked the website and all it says is that if you are travelling economy, you MAY be asked to have your cabin baggage checked in. “May”. So I thought I may be okay on the way back.

Let’s go to the flight back. I was already worried about this and asked if I could keep the bag, close to crying, when the flight attendant asked me to hand over the bag.
I offered to pay extra and explained that just had surgery two days ago and just want to get home (and also, that the last time I had a checked in bag/in cargo bag, it was lost by the airline, so I have been making sure to Never use the checked in bag service as I literally have a phobia of this).
I said I will pay extra if they let me take it up.
I was told absolutely no one on economy can take their cabin bag and I can upgrade for approx £180 (to business class).

You should make it clear that you do not allow anyone to take their cabin bag and make it clear that we are only allowed a handbag (if not on business class).
Also, if you are late more often than other companies, no point in booking with you, when you are more expensive. Misleading company. Thanks for making me meltdown and be the last straw after a stressful time and let’s hope you don’t lose my cabin bag, because that will not go down well.",1.0,London,Budapest,Europe,November 2024,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"I recently booked a flight from Manchester to Male, Maldives with British Airway (BA) for the purpose of SCUBA diving.
At first sight, their bag policy appeared to be generous. The weight limit for bags/cases when flying standard Economy is as follows:
•	Check-in (Hold) Bag is 23 kgs
•	Cabin (Carry-on) Bag: 23 kgs
•	Small (under seat) Bag: 23 kgs
The first problem is that as the size limits for the Cabin Bags and Small Bags are considerably smaller than for Check-in Bags, it is almost impossible to fill them to the 23 kgs allowance (unless the passenger wanted to carry lead weights - which is unlikely and would probably be a security issue), so the ‘generous offer’ on the BA website is misleading!

However, the much greater problem is that I had intended to take a Dive Propulsion Vehicle (DPV) with me. The model that I had purchased is specifically designed and certified to be compliant with both the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and the International Air Transport Association (IATA) regulations as safe for transport in an airline passenger plane, providing that the correct procedures are followed. That means the lithium (Li-ion) batteries must be removed from the DPV, isolated from each other and carried separately in a Cabin Bag, thereby leaving the rest of the DPV as an inert shell to be safely carried in a Check-in Bag, where it could not possibly cause any fire risk.
The BA website states under ‘RESTRICTED AND PROHIBITED ITEMS’ > ‘BATTERIES, ELECTRIC AND ELECTRONIC DEVICES’, that passengers may carry up to 4 spare (removed from the device) li-ion batteries (not exceeding 100Wh) per person in hand baggage (Cabin or Small Bag). 
That paragraph gave clear information as to the limits of the li-ion batteries that I wished to carry on the flight and the preparations that would be required. Furthermore I contacted BA Customer Support, who assured me that as long as the correct precautions were followed and the relevant certification supplied (bearing in mind my DPV is CAA and IATA compliant), I would be permitted to carry the DPV on the flight. Another paragraph on the BA website under ‘BAGGAGE ESSENTIALS > SPORTS EQUIPMENT’ is titled ‘DIVING EQUIPMENT’.  Though it doesn’t specifically mention DPVs, it states that “You can take most items as part of your checked baggage allowance if it’s packed in a recognised kit bag and doesn’t exceed the maximum size and weight for checked baggage”.
At this point I felt that I had researched the issues diligently enough to be confident that bringing the DPV with me was permissible, so on that understanding I bought my ticket to the Maldives. 
Unfortunately, a few weeks after having made the booking I browsed through the BA website again and found yet another section called ‘SPORTS AND RECREATIONAL ITEMS’ > ‘SMALL ELECTRIC LEISURE E-VEHICLES AND PROPULSION DEVICES POWERED BY LITHIUM BATTERIES’, in which underwater propulsion devices were specifically prohibited on board BA aircraft, either as Check-in or Cabin Bags! Due to the confusion I made about 10 further calls the BA Customer Services in an attempt to get a definitive answer about taking my DPV, and despite all of the agents escalating my query to their supervisors, all except one of them interpreted the BA rules/web site as allowing a passenger to take a DPV such as mine, provided the appropriate precautions were taken.
I eventually discovered that such policy is made by the BA Corporate Safety Team. As no phone number is available, and the Safety Team is aloof, it took an email to the CEO of BA to receive a phone call from the Safety Team manager, in which he said that he would not compromise safety by allowing a DPV on a BA flight. No one would argue against that statement, but he demonstrated a lack of understanding as ONLY the li-ion batteries have the potential to pose a safety hazard, not the rest of the DPV (which is just an inert shell). According to IATA, devices such as my DPV should be treated as a Portable Electronic Device (PED), so if BA considers li-ion batteries to be an unacceptable risk, why does it have an allowance for them on the website?? 
As my basic qualification is similar to those in the BA Corporate Safety Team, I would argue that all safety issues should be risk assessed, and with regard to li-ion batteries this has not been properly done by BA. Instead they have implemented an across the board policy that shows lack of understanding and is inconsistent, even within their own website and beyond that required by the CAA and IATA. This policy is effectively in conflict with the information in the ‘BATTERIES, ELECTRIC AND ELECTRONIC DEVICES’ paragraph! The refusal to carry a device that is powered by batteries that fall within BA’s own stated limits is extremely misleading as well as illogical! 
Although my flight ticket was ‘non-refundable’, I requested a refund NOT because I wanted to cancel the flight but because BA was largely removing my reason for going due to their misleading website and illogical, inconsistent policy! 
Predictably, a refund was refused. What a shame it is that our national flag carrier has descended into such a low level of service and competence, so I will not fly with BA again unless they have a serious shake-up.",1.0,Manchester,Male,International,November 2024,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0
"I honestly wonder why people still fly to London and choose British airways. Worst experience ever.
We bought our tickets on BA from Rome. Apparently no other airline flies to Heathrow except BA. 2 days before our departure, we decided to pay for an upgrade to treat ourselves. My husband went to the airport first to drop of the bags. All normal. I check in about 20mins after him. At check in i was told by the check-in staff there is no food for me on the flight. I was surprised so I asked why. Very rudely I was told that it is not only me but there is no catering on the flight. I was given a eur15 voucher to eat before I board the flight. Obviously my husband who check in 20mins before me did not get the voucher.
In any case what can you eat at Rome Airport? Than the flight was delay for over an hour. The crew did make some announcement about no catering on the flight and we were offered only water and some nuts because this is what they have.
really unacceptable. And to top it all, on our return flight, we flew economy this time because it is not worth to pay business class. our baggage was damage.
I think BA could be by far one of the worst airline to fly with and needless to say Heathrow airport is just horrible. Security staff were extremely rude and the whole airport is so unfriendly. we have written to BA requesting for a refund for the upgrade we paid which we did not get any service. than we also reported our damage baggage. not very hopeful that BA will do anything after this experience.

"After a five hour delay with another airline  I missed my connecting flight from London to Amsterdam. My checked luggage made it to London.

Since I was traveling back to Heathrow I requested that the luggage be kept at Heathrow until I traveled there a few days later.

"I have flown multiple times with British Airways from Cayman to Heathrow and unfortunately each experience has been as bad as the last when flying economy.
Flying premium economy is a breeze and you actually get treated like a human, if you can afford it.. Flying economy... Forget about it!
I spilled a drink on myself and the tray during the flight and as I was sitting in the window seat on an overnight flight, I didn't want to disturb the other passengers beside me, I asked an attendant for a napkin.. I was told to ask the colleague behind her, the next attendant laughed at me and said they don't store napkins in the drink cart and walked away?! I had to wake up the 2 passengers next to me and go get my own, I'm sorry but what happened to common decency.
I've been told that I'm not allowed to have my blanket drapped over my legs by an attendant before when multiple passengers next to me had there's the same, I guess she didn't like my face after I refused to give up the seat I paid for to be put in an inadequate alternative after being told I would not get a refund for my purchase.
I've asked for an extra pillow before due to a medical condition, which was explained to the attendant, at that time I was also belittled and felt that I should be extra grateful that she went and 'stole' it from the world class traveller section.. Is that really a big ask?
Bare in mind, all of these incidents happened on different flights and were not an accumulation of perceived constant annoyances by a passenger. 
It's very disappointing that the flight attendants can't muster an ounce of care or decency for their customers.

First flight cancelled before we got to the airport . Fair enough .
Next day we’re on the plane all the way to the runway and sit there for 5 hours to be told amongst around 5 other reasons that now the navigation is broken .
Which he then says it’s fixed 2-3 times as we go to literally fly off in an unsafe plane for hom to change to oh no still broken.

2nd Flight cancelled they tell us to take our 2 small children to the Hilton hotel pay for it ourselves and we will be refunded . Rediculous but ok .
We traipse around Gatwick to find Hilton with a que down the terminal ..
We waited an hour to be told rooms are now full .
What a joke BA didn’t even ring ahead or anything + zero BA workers around all hiding as angry passengers were around as you can imagine .
Anyway got our own hotel far away and awaited the next flight the next day ..
Here’s where it gets past Rediculous - 
We get on the 3 rd flight the next day to sit there another 5 hours and be told the exact same issue - navigation broke flight cancelled .
Now I’m really frustrated + my family .
I’m asking the attendant are they that stupid to try and fly the same broken plane as the last 3 days ? .
His answer I’m not sure .
Anyway my disabled fathers in law had enough and decided to make a small protest and stay on the plane to get some answers .
What they all had to say including the pilot you’ll be amazed -
“ these planes are all very old and not looked after at all . This plane has had this same issue for months and is over 40 years old .
The company don’t really care ..
At this point I’m in complete shock it seems they’re all very used to it .
The only thing they have on their side is oh you’ll be compensated  for all missed flight as we’re very good at that “ ,

We later found out that, while Gatwick terminal south was indeed evacuated, they could have still sent a plane but chose not to as it was uneconomical.

"Extremely Disappointing Experience with British Airways

I had the unfortunate experience of having my flight from Barcelona London on 14 October 2024 with British Airways canceled a FEW HOUR BEFORE DEPARTURE!
First and foremost, the cancellation left me in a difficult position, needing to purchase new tickets at the last minute. This not only caused unnecessary stress but also resulted in significant additional costs. To make matters worse, despite my attempts to contact the airline for clarity and assistance, my claim was refused!!!

British Airways’ response was impersonal and failed to offer any tangible solutions. They did NOTHING to compensate for the disruption caused by their decision to cancel the flight. It was clear that no real effort was made to help rebook or alleviate the financial burden caused by this event.
I understand that cancellations can happen, but the lack of meaningful customer service and unwillingness to take responsibility for the resulting inconvenience was extremely disappointing.
I will certainly be reconsidering flying with British Airways in the future!

"Just experienced probably the worse long haul flight ever, and I've done many.
Flew into Doha on Malaysian, excellent service and food, then the BA horror, sat on tarmac, very hot for an hour as the onboard auxiliary power unit was known to be not working and ground units were found.
Seat 32E on 777, apart from the miserly 31' of legroom there was a fixed metal box under the seat in front really restricting leg room, and forcing sitting at an angle. See photo 
In flight entertainment had to be rebooted twice, stewardess got the wrong seat first, and after that was average.
7.5 hour flight started with a sandwich and a glass of wine, after that crew appeared to disappear until 5 hours later when a rushed, very average breakfast was served, coffee was asked for twice before being begrudgingly served.
In fact the crew really didn't want to serve and lots of eye rolling and terse comments when simple requests were made

"I think the biggest let down with BA are the cabin staff. They are there for themselves and any other BA employees travelling on the flight, everyone else is a job that has to be done. 

On our night flight they spent the entire time chatting amongst themselves in the galley. I could hear it even with the ear plugs in. Compare that to any of the Asian airlines where the customer comes first and they would be mortified if there was any suggestion their noise had kept people awake. 

The hard product on our A380 was Ok. Seats a bit narrow and aisle seats very prone. I had some technical issues with my remote control - you couldn’t play games on it and the sound packed up towards the end of the flight.

Meal orders were taken and served on the basis that you knew what the deal was so hurry up and order. Again we were just a job to be done. With someone like Thai Air they keep checking everything is OK and even thank you personally towards the end of the flight. This lot couldn’t wait to get rid of us so they could hit the hotel bar.

Toilets on the upper deck by the roped off stairs to the lower deck were a good size and particularly on the left side offered room to change clothes.

BA are unique in my experience in charging business class passengers £500 per couple to select seats. Someone next to us didn’t pay the money and had their partner in the lower deck so they didn’t see them the entire flight. Fortunately the 2 off duty cabin crew flying with us managed to get seats next to each other so that was good. We’ve been separate on an A380 before so learned our lesson. You do have to remember to add £500 when comparing flights on Google.

"I would not recommend British Airlines under any circumstances due to their lack of customer support and unwillingness to reimburse a customer, even after they have cancelled a flight. Their customer support team won't talk to you. The only way to reach a real person is via chat, and you have to first argue with the AI bot before you can talk to a human. 
Our situation: We had reservations for a round trip flight from Portland, OR to Marco Polo (Venice, Italy), returning 15 days later from Rome to Portland. I paid extra for aisle seats, which we did not get because the flight was delayed in Portland and we missed our connection in Heathrow. I have yet to be reimbursed for this expense, after over a month of inquiries. 
In addition, the airline cancelled our flight back to the US without notifying us, and we discovered it the day before we were set to fly back home. BA had no available flights back to Portland for days, which would not work for us because my husband takes heart medications and needed to be back home to resupply them. 
BA customer support, available only through chat, would not help us book a flight back home on another flight, so we paid over 3K to get tickets on KLM on our own. No reimbursement: Since the flight, I've not been compensated for the tickets we had purchased for the cancelled flight. I've contacted customer support multiple times, including: filling out forms online (which give error messages), contacting via chat (the only thing that works), calling their customer support number (they do not answer it ever), and even talked to an agent at my local airport who said they have no contacts with customer support. She gave me a card with a number that the customer support never answers. The people on the Chat line say that 'their dedicated customer support team' cannot be reached by phone, and would not give me the name of the manager to contact. They simply will not talk to you by phone. I may have to go to small claims court to get reimbursed. It's a scam, in my opinion. Save yourself headaches.

3. No one ever calls me  back or replies no matter the question

5. They drop you down to whatever executive club though if one flies business any executive club status will be useless unless gold, as one gets other perks with one’s business class ticket anyway! So what’s the point of any other club??!

"We booked to fly with British Airways on our family holiday in July this year and were quickly disappointed. Our outward flight from Gatwick was cancelled around 4 weeks before departure with no notification email or call to let us know. The only reason we found out about the cancellation was when we were planning our journey to the airport and looked up the flight time! There were no alternative flights on the same day so we were forced to take a flight from an alternative  airport on a different departure date, this in turn messed up our accommodation plans which also had to be altered. 
As a family travelling with two children aged 10 & 6, we knew that we would be allocated seats together on the flight but unfortunately, we were allocated the last row on the plane with no windows to see out. Whilst this is one of those unlucky things, it’s quite claustrophobic sitting in these seats and was not a great experience, especially with the children.
Following this experience on our outbound flight, I decided to upgrade our cabin seats for the return journey costing just short of £150. Our pre-booked seats were towards the front of the plane which also secured us an earlier exit from the plane with the children upon landing which was a bonus. When I attempted to check-in online before our flight, the seats that were showing as allocated were not the prepaid seats I’d booked. I tried to contact BA whilst still abroad but having been on the phone for over 45 minutes waiting, I decided to wait until we arrived at the airport to deal with any discrepancy, after all, I had my seat booking confirmation documents. When we arrived at the airport, I was informed at check-in that our seats had been allocated to other passengers and that we were much further down the plane aisles. The check-in staff could not assist with a refund and advised me to raise a claim and send any boarding passes to the customer service deptartment for a refund.
Due to the miscommunication regarding our outward flight, I had already raised a claim for additional expenses incurred due to the flight cancellation so therefore I added the cost of the seat upgrade and further remarks regarding the poor customer service to the existing claim. My claim for the additional expenses on the outbound flight were £75 and the seat upgrade £150 on the return flight. My first claim was rejected, and I have received only a £50 voucher for the 2nd claim.
I feel like this is disgusting. Basically, if I hadn’t double checked our flight time originally, then we potentially could have arrived at the airport with no flight for us to get on! The customer service from BA is the worst that I have ever experienced. It is virtually impossible to get through to speak to a human being to resolve any problems that you are having. Everything has to be completed online and then it takes forever to get any response and when you do you are told that your claim is rejected. British Airways are quick to take your money for a service offering of upgraded seats but when you don’t receive the service that you have paid for in full, they give you back a third of what you have spent! When you try to contact them regarding your claim, which they have now closed, you cannot speak to anyone because they do not have a specific department set up to deal with any further issues so therefore you need to raise another claim again! The only problem with this is, our flight was in July, they closed the claim and now the system does not recognise our flight no because it has passed and no longer exists! Very Clever British Airways, now you no longer have to deal with our complaint as you’ve made it impossible to contact you!
I would advise that you avoid using British Airways altogether, fly with a cheaper airline and upgrade with them as best you can or spend the money that you have saved by not flying BA on other things that bring you joy on your holiday/trip. British Airways are happy to take your money in the first instance but as soon as there are any problems then you literally have no chance of getting any money back, just a small voucher offering which you can only spend with them, no thanks!!!!

Adding to the frustration, I received an email from British Airways offering a refund for any purchases from the High Life Café.

If the service paid for could not be offered you must compensate accordingly. And the email says they only know if a seat is broken if passengers tell them, so you never check them? That will be why the lady in the row in front had the same problem then!!!!

"For clarification, this review is with regard to the internal customer service/reservations line, and not our actual flight.   

We have been huge BA loyalists for well over 12 years, recommending them (and the Chase BA Visa) to anyone who would listen.  We have been very happy with the flight crews, and would generally always rate our flights at a 9 or 10. Website functionality and options remains dismal, but both are surmountable. Our heated complaint comes from the dreadfully abominable service provided to those of us who were in Valencia Spain during the horrific and tragic flooding. We are blessed not to have been  otherwise impacted by the death and destruction of storm Dana, as so many local people were, but we were stranded.  Due to the storm, the airport, roads and rail were all shut down, and we, like many others, were unable to leave the city. Although we had multiple reservations (and rescheduled reservations) for trains and planes,  these functions were inoperable.  We spent over 4 hours and made well beyond 6 contacts with BA trying to reschedule our flights to LHR, in order to fly home.  We had been stranded in Valencia a total of 7 days.  While I don't expect BA to give us a full refund on anything outside of their span of control,  I would have expected to at least get a credit on one or both of the flights that we could not make due to flooding, and allow us to use the credit for the flight from Valencia to LHR when the airport finally opened back up. Instead, we lost money and points for two flights. They also charged us for change fees. At no point did we ever get a clear accounting of the final fare costs, but rather stitched it together from our bank account statements.  But the real salt in the wound was the complete inability to get someone who could help us simply move our LHR flight 2 days out, since we were stranded. There is absolutely no reason why we had to speak to so many agents to try and get the flights moved, especially as they had confirmed that there were seats available.  They couldn't calculate the new fare, couldnt connect us to the right department, gave us the number and extensions (extensions were incorrect,)  we got a recording which automatically disconnected us, on and on. Avios can't talk to commercial, vice versa, and they can't transfer you, needed to call us back, (never did) gave us different rules on several calls.  In the end, we had two very nice female agents who assisted us and finally got the flight moved.  I can't imagine having lost a loved one (or a home or business) in this flood and then having to deal with this abominable service from BA. 

We realize that good help is hard to find post pandemic, but this was just not acceptable service, and definintely not up the the BA standards that we are used to.  One can only hope that the pilots are recieving better training and oversight than the agents. In general, the flight crews and lounge employees of late just don't seem to love what they are doing like they used to, which leads to a question of BA's leadership. This has left us with a really bad taste in our mouths for BA, which is super disappointing for us, since we have been huge cheerleaders.",1.0,Valencia,London,Europe,November 2024,N/A,N/A,N/A,1.0,1.0,N/A,N/A,N/A

"Disappointing service, plane interior and terribly incompetent customer service
I booked my flight directly through BA's website. Soon after I started to get emails saying my selected seats (I paid extra for the selection) had been changed by BA without any reason given and I was directed to the website. There I found no information on the said seat change. This happened several times (I had 4 flights altogether). The website seems to be a digital dinosaur. 
The first leg of my flight was fine, until I discovered in the transfer area at Heathrow that I forgot my new laptop onboard. Immediately I contacted BA's so called Customer Service (what an oxymoron), which basically said they can not do anything, I would have to wait until the cleaners (working for a contractor) would have finished their job and hope they would discover the laptop and return it to so called Lost & Found at the airport. BA's customer service said they couldn't contact their colleagues in the terminal/gate were the plane was still and let them know there was a lost laptop by seat no 27A of the plane (yes I told them exactly were the laptop was). They wouldn't take any contact details either to notify me if and when the laptop would be returned and they refused to register the incident. They simply had no interest in assisting me and didn't even make an attempt to pretend they did. Communication via their online customer service was poor, and they didn't even respond to my messages. In the end I emailed the representative at Heathrow and he replied with a message form his supervisor (which did not reveal his name): 'It is not the duty of British Airways to find lost property on behalf of our passengers, however if you would like to dispute this you can contact customer relations online with further feedback.' They took no responsibility and referred me to Smartecarte, which is the contractor cleaning their planes and apparently collecting lost items. I have not received the laptop, worth 2 thousand GBP, back now 3 weeks later.

The flights between London and Cape Town (~12 hours), were unpleasant. The flight attendants were seemingly unenthusiastic about their job, it took up to an hour to collect the trash after the meal, which also was distributed extremely slowly. Food was not good. Boarding was slow and inefficient. Drinks were only offered twice (otherwise you'd have to ask for it especially) on this long flights. The seats were of fabric, uncomfortable and room too scarce to relax and sleep.

"I had the worst customer service experience with British Airways (BA). They changed our flights from Goa to London, switching the airport from GOI to GOX, but failed to update the system accordingly. As a result, the details of our flights were missing.

When our flight was cancelled, BA rebooked the tickets, which appeared correctly on my app (which I have screenshots off). However, upon arrival at the airport, the airline had no record of our flights. Contacting BA, we were informed that they had no knowledge of the new flights and claimed that if they had booked them, they would need my consent and payment.

"British Airways has massively decreased quality. Not only are the booking process, app and possibilities to contact them  very poor (long waiting time at hotline, no invoices for seat reservation in die time, not user-friendly app), but also the comfort on board lacks of quality:
Booked World Traveller Plus (=premium eco). Seat width an leg room rather ok, but seats very hard for a long flight, and reclining not very much. 
Entertainment screen reacts very slow. Only few toilets, which are located in the middle of and shared with the economy class - which would basically be ok, but the number of toilets is too low for the amount of passengers. Furthermore people have to queue in the aisles, which are very narrow, so that you cannot make your way to the toilets without colliding with seated people. 
We paid a lot extra for premium economy, but British Airways seems to save money on meals: they advertise high quality meals with a choice of Indian and Asian food, but in the end it turned out that already the second row, where we were seated, in  our premium cabin did not have the choice of meals any more, so that we had to take the rest (shared with eco??). 
WiFi did not work. 
Positive: a friendly and motivated crew. 

Customer service, to whom we addressed our problems with the booking processes and invoice topic is very bad. Not targeting satisfaction of customer.

"I recently traveled from Munich to London with British Airways, and it turned into an absolute nightmare. Our troubles began with their malfunctioning app. Despite checking in successfully, I was unable to retrieve our boarding passes.

Upon arrival at the airport, we discovered that there were no self-service kiosks, and the check-in desks were completely unattended. After seeking help from the information desk, we were directed to a staff member who clearly did not want to assist us. Her dismissive attitude was infuriating, and despite showing her the app indicating we were checked in, she simply told us to call customer service and walked away without providing any assistance.

After being put on hold for 25 minutes and being sent to several different staff members who couldn’t help us, we finally reached someone on the phone who was kind but ultimately powerless to resolve our issue. By this point, our flight was delayed, and we had wasted two hours just trying to print our boarding passes.

When I followed up with a complaint, British Airways basically dismissed my concerns and told me to use the app next time—ignoring the fact that it was the app's failure that caused all these problems in the first place!

This experience cost us a staggering £682.43 in additional expenses, including new flights, hotel stays, taxi fares, and fines. Missing work and explaining this absurd situation to my employer was incredibly embarrassing.

British Airways clearly needs to improve its customer service and technology. If their app and website are going to fail, they must provide adequate support at the airport.

"If you are considering flying World Traveller Plus on BA, I would strongly advise you to reconsider, because I recently discovered that there is no guarantee you will receive the benefits the airline promises. I decided to treat myself and my teenage daughter to World Traveller Plus on the return leg of our Canada holiday, paying hundreds of pounds extra to do so... only to end up spending nine and a half hours trapped in a broken chair staring at a blank screen after both our entertainment systems failed to work. I hadn't bought a book or uploaded a film because I had assumed I would be enjoying the entertainment BA had promised. So I decided to lie back and get some rest instead... only to discover that the leg rest on my seat didn't work. The flight attendant was able to prop it up manually by shoving things underneath, but unfortunately this only made matters worse because it became firmly stuck in the up position, forcing my body into an awkward position during the descent, when I had to keep my seatback upright, leaving me with back pain that lasted three days (I have a bad lower back). Early on in this experience I asked to be moved to economy so that I could sit normally and watch a film, but the flight was full and there was no space. The apologetic flight attendant assured me I would receive compensation, which I assumed meant the airline would, at the very least, upgrade us the next time we flew BA, since we had been unable to enjoy any of the advertised benefits of World Traveller Plus (the two of us only had one suitcase each, so hadn't made use of the extra baggage allowance).

BA's actual compensation offer: £25 worth of Avios points each.

I wrote back (since BA doesn't allow you to have any direct telephone contact with their complaints department) explaining firmly but politely that this was not fair or acceptable, given the hundreds of extra pounds I'd paid for added extras the airline had failed to deliver. 
They then ghosted me.

My experience is a cautionary tale about British Airways customer support. If all goes to plan, you may well have a very pleasant World Traveller Plus experience. But if anything should go wrong, support staff will wash their hands of you and your money will have been wasted. So unless you're prepared to gamble, I would advise you to either stick with Economy/World Traveller (since then you're only really paying to fly from A to B, which they do manage to do) or fly with another airline. Or you could end up like me: throwing away extra money on an experience that fell far below the standard of economy class. 

If your flight is to Canada, I would recommend an airline such as Air Canada, which I turned to during the uncertainty of the Covid pandemic because of their exceptional customer service and fast, no-nonsense refunds. They do cost a bit more, so when life returned to normal post-Covid, I started flying BA again, believing such high standards of customer service were no longer important.

"Don't pay a premium rate for a Flight and Rental Car combination with British Airways as the service is now substandard.

Our contract stating that a Rental Car would be ready and waiting at AVIS Denver upon landing. After collecting bags and going through security we spent an hour queuing at AVIS to then be told there was no car.
The first alternative offered after a delay had already been sold to somebody else when we went to get it.
The car they then found, after more waiting, (the only one they could offer, allegedly, despite being paid for in advance) was a high mileage vehicle - not the best.

This is attributable to AVIS but as the contract was with British Airways I raised the matter with their 'Customer Services'.

I had two complaints in parallel (as the first one did not get the promised email confirmation so I resubmitted the same script).

Despite being on separate tickets they both received separate but identical generic responses, with no reference to the breach of contract, from a 'Customer Service' delegated overseas who then unilaterally closed both cases (though didn't bother to tell me). They have then repeatedly failed to provide requested details of the appropriate body to escalate this complaint to instead replying with generic fluff from a pre-written script.

They took £2600 but were too busy to take my first call, hung up on the second one after it dialed through, and the third one, connected to an overseas call centre, was hung up when I said I had a complaint.

We were greeted nicely but unlike Virgin, as soon as you sit in your seat, it was probably over an hour into the flight before we got offered our first drink.  Drink choices were vodka, gin or whisky in the spirit line, red or white wine or soft drinks like coke, fanta or water.  I don't drink any of these spirits and only drink Guinness besides, so you can imagine my disappointment when i didn't want any of these after paying for it.  It didn't end there, we were given menus and the air hostesses came around and recommended the Chicken dish for our dinner.  That again was the only choice for me because i didn't want the vegetarian or fish.  When it came to serving us, they had run out of the chicken dish, bearing in mind premium economy consists of 6 rows of 8 seats, total of 48 seats, so why recommend the only dish that i would eat if they were limited.
After not being able to have a drink to relax, i had a real job to try and sleep, especially because i was left with water bottles and crisp packets that no one collected.  People around me were just putting everything under the seats but i though this was a safety issue if we had to evacuate the plane quickly.
I am not a complainer but felt this had to be addressed, so i wrote to BA direct before posting this for everyone to see.  Here is their response, which is why i went to social media.

'We're sorry to hear about your recent experience with us. This isn't what you should expect, and we understand why you needed to complain.
 
Please rest assured that your feedback has made a difference. Your comments have been shared with the relevant team and we'll be using them to help us do better next time. We'd also like to thank you for your patience while we got back to you.
 
Once again, please accept our apologies. We hope to welcome you on board soon.

"Terrible airline. Plane was dated, staff overworked. Delayed flight caused us to miss our connecting flight. Then they booked us on a flight that was already overbooked. After the attendant said she got us on a flight early enough so that we wouldn’t have to worry about being double booked. We landed in the AM and our new flight was in the late afternoon. Now we have to wait and see if some passengers don’t make the flight, as one of us has to be on stand-by.

"Worst customer service ever! I had booked with BA as I thought they were still the reputable airline I remember flying with many years ago. Unfortunately I was mistaken. 

When boarding, the BA flight attended rolled her eyes at me when she realised I didn't have my passport in my hand. My passport was in my handbag and it took me seconds to get it out and hand it to her. I was shocked at the rudeness. 

On the flight, on several occassions the flight attendants walked past us with the trolley as though they could not see us. We had to call them back. When they came back, we asked for 2 orange juices and a water. The flight attendant shrugged his shoulders and rolled his eyes and sighed as though our request was overwhelming to him or annoying to him.

It was so terrible. I will NEVER flying with BA again. They have disgusting customer service. And I advise you to stay away from this airline especially if you are not a white person.",1.0,London,Bridgetown,International,October 2024,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

"Flew with BA for our honeymoon and was looking forward to it seeing as I haven't flown with them before.
The flight going to Mauritius left 1 hour and 40 minutes late. When we got on the plane the pilot our flight time was 1 hour less than planned but that we were waiting for other people, I assume this was because we couldn't arrive earlier than expected in Mauritius. After an hour they then said we were still waiting for other passengers from a connecting flight, who did then arrive. I've never known a flight to wait almost 2 hours for other passengers. 
Two people next to me were getting connecting flights in Mauritius so they were frustrated and confused.
This of course meant we landed late and had been on the plane for over 14 hours.
The free WiFi 'wasn't available for the flight' but you could purchase it for £22 which is insane, I have never flown long haul and the airline has not provided free WiFi.
The choice of films and TV again I found poor.
Coming back again the flight left late, and the free Wi-Fi again wasn't available. 
The food I didn't enjoy on the way back.
When we landed, about 20 suitcases came through then nothing happened for about 20 / 30 minutes. Finally got our bags, that combined with the delayed take off and landing again put us behind getting home.

I was dissapointed with BA and won't be using them again.

"This flight was turned round 2 hours in due to a drunk and disorderly passenger. Fair enough the airline cannot do much about that, but questions have to be asked why we had to return to LV. The worst part, however, was the airline telling us to leave bags on the aircraft ready to get going back to London Heathrow again. 1 hour later and we are told flight is cancelled. The agent advised BA would not be putting anyone up in a hotel, and to look out for alternative flights. All of this happening at 2am. Nothing is open.

Tried to complain via the official channels and received a scripted reply and an offer of a gift voucher. I will never fly BA again. No escalation process seems to be present for complaints and they never replied to the initial response. I am not surprised given the lack of customer engagement on here and trust pilot.

"Poor .Flew from Venice To London. Plane was 41 minutes late and were held up in customs due to conveyor problems. Missed flight BA225 to New Orleans. My wife is handicapped and our luggage left on the missed flight. Attendant took us to a lounge area and there was a effort to try to get us a flight but it was going to Chicago next day. After a period of time we were handed off to another person. She said  initially she could not find were we was booked on that flight. My wife supplied her with Boarding pass number and she found it and told her to take a seat and she would get back with us. We were in Executive lounge and she came out with ticket to Chicago with a second flight to New Orleans the next day. so my wife asked if we could stay the night in the lounge and she told her no it closed at 10.30. So she says I guess we can stay in the airport then> She said no you have to leave the airport. My wife was Flustered at this point and said what do you expect us to do walk the streets of London all night? She said this is the Airlines fault. She finally says well I can get you a motel room. Which she did. We had no vouchers and paid for a cab . Next morning we had to pay shuttle to take us back to airport. Fast forward we got to Chicago that night and Wheel chair person said your connecting flight to New Orleans h
as left.   GOOD; They found a British Airline agent . She took action. The flight to New Orleans was found at United airlines the next day. Printed out Boarding passes immediately.

"I am really disappointed with the experience. The flight was delayed from London. The food on the flight is really mediocre. It was extremely difficult to put the API on the site as the site is so so user user-unfriendly. 
The customer service on the flight was really poor. When I already boarded my flight back to UK and took my seat  a very unfriendly flight attendant came to me and asked in a very unfriendly manner what my name was and where I my seat was. I had a printed boarding pass  and showed it to her to confirm that I did actually sit in the right place. I assume I was approached because I was sitting on the emergency row and maybe it is usually stays empty. I couldn't explain her unfriendly curiosity otherwise. There was no smile, there was no 'sorry', there was just an ugly piece of communication. I was observing the flight attendants on both flights and they came across so so miserable. I don't fly BA for any pleasure flights but I am a frequent flyer and I am used to much friendlier staff, so I was quite surprised how unfriendly BA staff come across. The girls who were bringing a bottle of water and some kind of unhealthy snack were lovely though on my flight back. The person who enquired about my sit was probably from the business part of the plane or was the one in charge, I don't know who she was to be honest. 
The legroom was good, the price for the flight is several times higher than its competitors price. The flight was paid off by my work, otherwise I don't know how one can justify using this airline with the ticket price for a very short flight equaling to the price to any exotic flight worldwide.",2.0,London,Amsterdam,Europe,October 2024,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,1.0
"Please believe the negative comments with BA. Firstly I'd like to begin with how horrible British airways is as I booked a baby basinet seat initially when booking, but on my flight I found out there is no basinet at all nor did the air hostesses assist me or my husband with a baby on a late night flight when they saw us struggle and weren't kid friendly if they couldnt assist with a child to make it easier for us parents and avoided us. She said she will come back to me but never did to check our details of what we booked but how can I when there is no internet onboard! On the flight then we were stuck in economy with no space even to take our luggages through, and were cramped with our baby with no air hostess around and when my husband couldn't put the seat belt on the air hostesses looked down at him for not knowing but instead another customer a gentleman with the baby seat belt had to do their job for us instead to put on! The air hostesses had no etiquette, no smile just hiding unless they came with food and apart from that we had no support with the overhead and they moved our push chair around and when it came to the seats we didn't get no headphones or blanket on some seat and had to give my baby my one. Atleast if they gave us reassurance then we'd be happy. We paid £850 each for our seats and even for our baby abit extra! I am not happy at all about our flight. Why advertise basinets only not to give it to those who pay for it!? Only good thing was entertainment is available but British attitude = rude British air hostesses who think their entitled. They thought they were too good for their boots but thankfully we arrived safely thanks to the captain but the air cabin crew not good enough!",1.0,Doha,London,International,October 2024,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,3.0

Even simple things like wifi on the planes. If you fly business class, you have to pay for wifi!!!

"I have flown British Airways for many years and still do so regularly.  In one of my last flights this past summer between Paris and Boston, British booked me on a connecting flight between Paris and London that gave me a maximum of 90 minutes to connect in London.  London Heathrow is a massive airport where going from terminal to terminal could take 20-30 minutes once you deplane, not including the actual time to deplane if you are seated in the back and lines at passport control and security between terminals.  So already, one is pressed for time.  My flight from Paris to London that day was tardy, 49 minutes tardy that day to be exact.  BA Flight 323 in fact, is routinely tardy. – don’t bother with this one.  

Flight Connections assisted me by calling the new gate to let them know my previous flight had been delayed and that I was rushing to the gate. It was 30 minutes before my connecting flight was to depart.  I ran like a fool for 25 minutes, carryons and all, arriving to the gate 5 minutes before my flight was to depart, only to be greeted by no plane.  The agent said that since no one knew where I was (false) the plane left without me – early.  Gaining a few minutes was more important than an passenger inconvenienced by their own delay.

So I made the 20 minute trek back to Flight Connections knowing that they would have to rebook me the following day. I was now going to miss the wedding I was destined to attend in Boston.  They sent me to a prepaid Hilton hotel room for the night but told me that I would have to pay 30 pounds each way for a taxi to take me there.  They gave me a pamphlet with instructions for reimbursement.  This was in early July.  It took me 4 months and a complaint to the British Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution to be reimbursed for the equivalent of $77.   There was no apology, no recognition, not even a free drink coupon for that next flight I won’t ever take with British.  Like a bad insurance claim, British just kept robo denying my claim, expecting that I would just go away.

"Recently flew BA’s nonstop between Boston and London on the A380.  It is a massive airplane with a payload of over 500 passengers.  Business class seating on this plane and on this route was not worth the $$ in my opinion.  There were too many seats in each row making the seats narrower than those offered by other airlines.  Most jumbo jets have a 1-2-1 configuration in business class; this plane had 2-3-2 and 2-4-2, twice as many seats in each row. This is particularly obnoxious if you are seated in the middle aisle because that means anyone seated in a window seat or in the middle seats has to crawl over an aisle passenger just to get to the bathroom and back.  If you do so in the dark on an overnight flight, it is actually unsafe for you and that poor aisle passenger.  Check the plane scheduled for the flight you want to take and if a 777 is offered, opt for that one.

Due to the damage, the luggage became extremely difficult to carry, forcing me to take a taxi instead of my planned bus ride. This incurred unexpected additional costs, which I otherwise would not have had to bear. 

British Airways compensated me with a new luggage. However, the sweatpants costed me around 200 pounds and 60 Pounds for the Taxi.

The flight itself was a good flight,  attendants did there job very well, it was unfortunate that a passenger in front of us had bad wind, maybe they shouldn't serve mushrooms with in-flight meals, that aside the seats really are unnecessary uncomfortable, it's clear that who ever designed the seats has never sat in one of them for more than a minute. The passenger directly in front of me had their armrest in the up position which left the reclining in that seat unlocked so every time they moved, which was frequent, the seat sprang backwards and forwards, again poor design, with everything that goes on in order for a passenger to reach their destination the one thing that should get the most attention is the seat you sit in, shame on you BA",2.0,London,Las Vegas,International,October 2024,1.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,3.0

"DO NOT USE, Refund refused, endless bad excuses! BA is one of the worst airlines around. Will NEVER use again!

Booked a return trip from Heathrow to Kolkata with BA. Paid the full amount for the trip to BA. Part of journey, from Kolkata to Mumbai, was provided by BA partner airline Vistara.

Less than 24 hours before flying from Kolkata to Mumbai, Vistara cancelled the flight. I found out by accident because I checked the useless BA app. While the app provided a button to rebook the flight, no option was available to me, and I had to book a separate flight from Kolkata to Mumbai with Air India.

When back in the UK, I contacted BA for a refund for the Kolkata to Mumbai trip, and was told that BA did not operate this route (despite the plane number is BA5863) and that I should contact Vistara. So I contacted Vistara, which told me that the trip was booked with BA, hence, I should contact them for a refund!

So here we have a typical example of big business happy to take your money, and to NOT provide the service, while asking their customers to run around in circles to get a refund that I am legally entitled to.

On top of that, I found the BA web-site a joke. It's almost impossible to find the refund form, and the web-page that allows you to add details to an existing claim does not work etc. etc. etc.
Their BA app is also of poor quality and extremely confusing to use.

"Having always travelled business class to Vegas I got a great deal on a 1st class seat to LA (then domestic to Vegas)

I done a lot of research and got things off to a start with the lounge. As I was connecting from Glasgow I didnt use the 1st class check in area which I forgot about but did want to experience it. oh well. The 1st class lounge was great. Not too busy compared to the business lounges. Even got a cabana room to chill in and shower for 90 minutes.

Onto the flight and was warmly welcomed by crew member who seeing my seat ushered someone to walk me to my seat. Ha Ha good start. The seat was better than business but not a lot. Everything about the seat was slightly better than business.

Would i do it again ?  Unless BA fly into Vegas direct with 1st class i will stick with business. Too much hassle GLA - LHR - LAX - LAS and the same back home.

We fly British Airways fairly often as most of the time we have to fly through London to get to the US from Prague.  I hate flying through London.  Most of the time we offload from the plane onto a bus to get to the terminal.  Then big hassle to make it to our connection to the US. This last flight coming back to Prague was typical.   Flight delayed.  Got into Prague about one and a half hours late. Business class in Europe means economy seat with no one next to you.  And they usually give you something to eat and drink.  The flights are hit and miss.  Sometimes good and sometimes bad.   This one was ok but late.

"Since the below review was written I have been compensated by BA after contacting customer services by email and will now consider using this airline again in the future:

Both my outbound and return flights cancelled without explanation and at last minute - lost a day of my holiday and had to re-book hotel and car last minute. Very stressful. Upon arrival at Orlando it took 45 minutes for my case to come onto the carousel.

For the return flight I was already at the airport when I found out about the cancellation by text. There was no-one at the desk. Had to re-book another flight via BA's online chat and they wanted to send me back to Heathrow! No good. Managed to get on a flight in the evening but that meant waiting at the airport all day (could have stayed in my hotel.)

Seats are very narrow for long haul. On the return flight I was constantly being pushed and bumped by other passengers and people walking down the aisle. Almost no leg room. Plane cabin was freezing cold for most of the flight.

Lodged a complaint and nearly 2 months later was given a £50 voucher but no explanation as to why both flights cancelled. Am planning future trips to the USA - will not be flying with BA again after this experience.",1.0,London,Orlando,International,July 2024,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0
"British Airways definitely not as good as it used to be.  On our return flight it was extremely hot in the cabin which seemed to be irritating people with dry throats and coughs.  We flew back 4 days after the recent hurricane, which the crew said accounted for the fact that they did not have enough food and drinks on board.  Only one drink was served with a small packet of pretzels, no drinks were served with the meal, no starter with the meal, a small bottle of water was on the tray, tea and coffee or water later on.  No other drinks provided at all.  When it came to a light breakfast nearly 5 hours later, they had no food to provide to anyone so offered a packet of biscuits or graze snacks and a juice or tea/coffee.

We were offered a cancellation of the holiday or to take their option of flying with the Polish Carrier, Lot Airlines flying to Warsaw with a transfer back to Budapest which we took as we needed a break, the flight was due to take off at 10.15 on 07/09/2024; however, it was delayed and we didn't take off until circa 12 noon, this meant our transfer to Budapest was also very rushed and frantic, and in turn our luggage did not arrive at Budapest with us, we had to complete a form asking for the luggage to be sent to the Rum Hotel in Budapest. The transfer we had paid for was not at the airport so we had to pay for a taxi, which added more cost. When we arrived at the hotel we were met with more disappointment, it was booked via a BA holiday and was classed as 4*, when in fact 2* was nearer the mark, it was awful, as you can see from the pictures, hanging behind the tv was a multi-plug with various plugs, the king-size bed had 2 single duvets instead of one king-size duvet, the bed side tables were lumps of wood, the bin in the bedroom was a miniature dust bin with a black bin liner. We were supposed to have a bottle of prosecco on arrival via the Mr & Mrs Brand which the hotel is listed with, was not there, and the one shown in the pictures was from our son and daughter and the view from our room was a building site. We both agreed the hotel was very disappointing, not the star rating it was supposed to be and not of the standard advertised in the pictures on the BA website, which meant that once our luggage arrived we would check out, at more cost to us. Our luggage arrived late Sunday afternoon and we then checked out, no-one asked why we were checking out as it did not seem to matter to them. We have written a letter of complaint to BA and do date we have not received a reply, they have become a shocking company and do not care about their customers, they have cut their costs to the bone and it shows, very disappointing, they take their customers for granted and cancel flights at will. They always seem to fund a loop-hole and make excuses for not paying out compensation.",1.0,London,Budapest,Europe,September 2024,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

"I bought to tickets (one for me, one for my wife), then later my plans changed because I had to attend a funeral so I phoned BA several weeks before the flight to cancel just my ticket. I was told this was done. I checked online after phoning BA and could see that my wife's booking was still valid and only for 1 passenger. I also received a cancellation email for just my ticket. The day before the flight my wife received an email inviting her to check in online. Attempting to check in online told her that this was not available for this ticket and that she would need to check in at the airport. Attempting to check in at the airport my wife was told that the cancellation procedure had been done wrong by the BA staff member I spoke to on the phone and that as a result although there was a valid booking there was no e-ticket (whatever that means). The woman on check-in told us that the only option was to buy a new single ticket at the cost of £400 - eight times the cost of the original single ticket. The woman on the check in desk (Nima) made out like it was somehow our fault for changing the ticket and the only option was for us to phone BA customer services - even though we were there in person at Heathrow Terminal 5 which was emblazoned with the message 'Welcome to the home of British Airways'. We were eventually able to speak to a supervisor who agreed that the situation was unjustifiable, and, after the supervisor spent over an hour on the phone, accepted that it was BA's mistake, but that the best he could do was offer us the option to buy a new replacement ticket on the same flight for an additional £54.

I don't mind when companies make mistakes, what is important to me is how they handle it when they do. BA's handling of this was atrocious:
1. The behaviour of the woman on the check-in desk simply defied all logic and any sense of fairness: implying it was somehow our fault, and then just repeating that effectively 'computer says no' and we would have to buy an entirely new ticket.
2. What really disgusts me is that the supervisor could see exactly what the problem was, and what the solution should be, and yet he had no authority to rectify it. He had to battle with the corporate system to get to the (still very unsatisfactory) stage where my wife could fly, but only after re-purchasing the ticket at the original cost.

What's worse is that this isn't a new issue. Doing some research online it becomes slightly clearer what has happened in this case: there has been a mix-up between the booking and the e-ticket. It is evident from numerous forum posts I found that problems of this sort appear to have been happening since at least 2010, with no sign of BA taking steps to tackle them.",1.0,London,Manchester,Domestic,October 2024,N/A,N/A,N/A,1.0,N/A,N/A,1.0,N/A
"I am extremely disappointed with the lack of customer service from British Airways. I have been waiting for over 8 months for a resolution to an issue I brought to their attention, and all I've received are generic emails apologizing for the delay, but with no action whatsoever.

This is not the level of service I expect from a major airline. The sheer amount of time I’ve waited for a response shows a complete disregard for customer concerns. It's clear that customer satisfaction is not a priority for British Airways.

"We planned for over two years for an Italian vacation, Rome, Naples, Positano and Florence.
Because of the length of the flight from Phoenix to London we upgraded to exit row seats for the leg room.
Because of the additional cost we were allowed 2 free checked bags.
The bags were not transferred on to Rome, when we realized they were still in London ( we had AirPods ) we went to lost and found and they assured us they would be in the next day.
We were only staying a couple days in Rome so they told us they would be sent to Naples which was our next destination.
They didn’t make either city in time and we had to move on to Positano with nothing.
We repeatedly called and emailed trying to get answers and received nothing.
They never even called us or apologized for anything.
While in Positano we called every day and they told us our bags would be sent to us.
Finally when we knew we weren’t going to get them before leaving Positano we called to say keep them in Naples we are coming back through and we will pick them up at the airport.
We got a very rude employee that said we wouldn’t be allowed to pick the bags up at the airport.
We had our schedule changed and left early to have enough time to get to the airport and still make our train to Florence, we were eventually able to find our luggage in the basement.
The process was difficult and time consuming and the employees acted like it was our fault.
Again no apology or compensation.
The rest of our trip went off relatively well and we are home now.
There has still been nothing from British Airways, the bottom line (they don’t care)
I very rarely ever review anything unless it’s extremely good or extremely bad, this was the latter for sure.
If you have an option even if it’s more go with someone else, this company doesn’t care about you.
They will tell you at the end of the flight that they know you have a choice and will thank you for choosing them but it’s all bull.

"On August 21, 2024, British Airways lost my luggage on a flight from London to Gothenburg. While I was relieved to learn that they eventually located my bag, I am absolutely frustrated by their failure to return it to me for nearly 6 weeks now.
 
Key issues:
1. Zero urgency in returning found property to its rightful owner
2. Lack of clear communication about return timeline
3. Unacceptable delay causing significant inconvenience
 
I have been patient and understanding, but 6 weeks to return a found bag is simply unreasonable. The items in my luggage are not just possessions - they have both monetary and personal value. This extended delay has forced me to replace essential items and has caused unnecessary stress and inconvenience.
 
Despite multiple attempts to get updates and expedite the return process, I have received no satisfactory response or resolution. This level of customer service falls far below the standards expected from a premium airline like British Airways.
 
I strongly advise potential customers to be wary of traveling with British Airways , as they seem unable or unwilling to handle basic baggage services efficiently. When they lose your luggage - even after finding it - you might be waiting for months to get it back.
 
British Airways needs to:
1. Immediately return my luggage
2. Provide compensation for the extended delay
3. Improve their lost baggage return procedures

"Absolutely rubbish. The BA staff at Heathrow T5 deserve a special mention for their appalling attitude. Internal flight delayed by 30mins, 60mins, 90mins, and then 2 hours.  It was clear that there was a problem and the flight maybe cancelled. 4 hours into the delay, the ground staff started checking in the priority borders, despite there not being a pilot or FO. These poor saps had to then stand in a cordoned off area for an hour. One old gentleman collapsed. Then the flight was cancelled 6 hours after it was due to depart, with the screen simply saying “cancelled- contact your airline”. Hundreds then trooped to the BA service desk to be met by bad tempered and disgruntled BA employees who clearly don’t enjoy their jobs. After a thirty minute wait where nothing was achieved, they shut the help desk, saying “we have homes to go to”. Ushered into the baggage arrivals area where we were met by more miserable staff who told us to wait at carousel 11 for bags. After a wait of an hour an announcement was made that passengers from cancelled planes weren’t going to get bags tonight, and we needed to leave the airport. Families and old people in particular were upset and confused. No baggage, no replacement flights, no hotels. Just left on their own. Made separate arrangements to get home via a competent airline.

On 8-25, BA informed me that BA53 had been ‘cancelled’ (no reason specified), and that I had been rebooked on a 4.00 pm flight from LHR, more than 6 hours later. On landing in LHR, BA refused to say anything about compensation, except to state that I have to file a claim online. They had rebooked me on BA49 which arrived in Seattle 6.40 pm on 8-26, more than 7 hours after my originally scheduled arrival by BA53 of 11.35 pm. I filed a flight delay compensation claim online 8-29. First, they rejected it by referring to some other flight cancellation on 8-2-24 due to ‘air traffic control restricted operations’. I wrote back to them clarifying that my claim related to the cancelled flight on 8-26-24, not 8-2-24. They responded by saying they had ‘another look at my claim for compensation and taken the time to make sure their response is accurate and up-to-date’, but again rejected my claim as the CANCELLATION was due to ‘extraordinary circumstances’, therefore no compensation was payable. I was able to verify from flight tracking websites that BA53 did in fact operate on 8-26, and gave BA the LHR departure time of 10.41 am from gate 34, as well as the Seattle arrival time of 12.52 pm. BA apparently bumped me from BA53, without my consent, but misinformed me that the flight was cancelled. Their own website indicates EU mandated compensation 600 Euros ($662), but it appears that they are brazening it out by falsely maintaining just that the flight was cancelled (it was not), but attributing the supposed cancellation to ATC restrictions! As per BA website EU mandated regulations requires BA to pay 600 Euros. The ticket was issued by British Airways, New York.

"Our group of six returned to California from Edinburgh on Sept. 26, 2024. It took four flights, BA Edinburgh to Heathrow; Heathrow to Dallas; then American Airlines Dallas to Phoenix; Phoenix to CA.  We had to collect our luggage in Dallas to go through Customs but no luggage appeared on the carousel for any of the 6 of us. After 30 minutes of waiting in line, we were told our luggage was still in Edinburgh and would catch up to us. Once getting home, two of us began an odyssey of online searching for someone at either airline to help. No human would help. BA said we must file a claim with AA and AA said we must file a claim with BA. BA website took us in circles but would not proceed to complete a claim no matter how many tries or even using different laptops and computers. Finally got claim filed with AA but their automated luggage tracker continued to say none of our bags has been scanned anywhere. The two of us logged 26 hours of time over five days trying to get information on our missing luggage. On the 5th day, one sympathetic customer service human at BA connected us to a baggage claim team member who finally located 5 of our bags in San Diego and the 6th in Phoenix and had them FedEx'd to us on the 6th day. In the end, no apology and no compensation from either airline. Indeed, since BA wouldn't allow a claim to be filed and AA's claim still today shows no bags scanned, so they might say there was no problems!

"Experienced 2 delays on our holiday to Punta cana through BA this was no fault of anyone other than BA.

However, punta cana airport is shockingly unorganised. Staff don’t have a clue, barely understand English and are just ignorant and don’t acknowledge you. 

We waited in lines for several hours through passport checks, getting looked up and down and clearly not welcomed. Staff don’t seem to know what their responsibilities are and have just have a poor work ethic.

Costs of refreshments and food are extortionate. Not a positive experience and actually have put a lot of people off going back to the country.

"Absolutely awful experience with BA. They cancelled our flight which was due to leave at 7:50am we were then rebooked onto a flight that arrived at 2:30am the next day. We didn’t find out until we were already at the airport at 5:30am. We went to the service desk to complain and to find out if there were any other flights and they sent us to a different desk. When we got to that desk they said they didn’t deal with it and that we should go back to the original desk. Having gone back to where we came from the assistant then had to phone her manager to find out who could deal with us only to send us back to where we were originally sent. After a lengthy back and forth with the other assistant she said BA could put us on standby for the 1:30pm flight but couldn’t guarantee us seats. She said they had space in business so if they upgraded some of their customers that would make seats available for us. I said why can’t you guarantee us seats by giving us business seats she said we could pay for them but they do not upgrade customers for free. We then asked to speak to the supervisor as we’re not willing to wait half the day of the first day of our holiday for the possibility of getting on a lunchtime flight. After another 45 minutes the supervisor gave us guaranteed seats on the 1:30pm flight but were not even together despite us having paid to sit together. At the gate they then forced me to check my cabin bag without any mention of this at baggage drop. This was to ensure the business customers had plenty of space for their bags (as they explained when I asked why only certain passengers were being forced to check cabin luggage). All the way through this the staff were rude and unhelpful implying that we should be grateful to even be in their presence. On the return journey BA very severely damaged my hard shell designer hold luggage bag to the point where it was just burst open on the luggage carousel. Several valuable and sentimental items were lost. The attendant at the desk barely acknowledged my existence and said it was a surprise because no other passengers had complained apart from one other about a damaged bag. Prior to this there was an announcement that they couldn’t get the luggage off the plane because there was damage to the hold doors so clearly it wasn’t that much of a surprise. No help was provided to help me get my bag in a place where I could move it without the remaining items falling out, I had to ask a different help desk for some tape (from American Airlines) to try and get it back together.

"If I could give this airline a negative review, I would. Horrible customer service, completely disorganized, and doesn't have their customer's best interest in mind. The hotel they gave us a voucher for was nice, but that was the only part of our experience that I have anything good to say. We missed our connecting flight due to our first flight being late, which was fine, not their fault. There were no other flights headed home that night, again, not their fault. We were told our bags made the connecting flight, and we were only a few minutes from making it but it was too late. So we got a hotel voucher, dinner pass, and shuttle pass. I had to get toiletries to get us through the night. We went to find the shuttle at the bus stop and time they gave us and waited for 45 minutes before another shuttle told us there would be no more coming for that hotel. So we took a cab. Our dinner vouchers expired at 8 and we didn't get to the hotel until almost 8:30. We got to the hotel, found ourselves a restaurant to eat at, and were notified out bags never got on the connecting flight and would be waiting for us at the airport. Since we already paid to have them checked, they said to bring it to the customer service counter and let them know, and they would take care of it. We got to the hotel early, got to the customer service desk, and at first he told us there were no seats on the flight we were re-booked for, and 'had to make a phone call to see what he could do.' 20 minutes later, he said we could get on the flight and not sit together. Again, fine. He told us we had to pay for our bags to be checked and file for reimbursement. We paid, and went through security with an hour to spare before our flight left. When we got to the gate, we were told they could not check one of our bags because 'there was no room' (which didn't make sense, I've only ever had an airline tell me they didn't have room for overhead luggage, and what is one more suitcase?) and so they made me take my bag and go through security again. I had prescription skincare products in it, and explained that to them, but they said they couldn't do it, but that if I wanted, they could put it on the flight the next day (I live 2 hours from the airport at home so that didn't work). I went through security and tried to explain to him as well, but the skincare was over the allowed liquid amount and so I had to throw it away, and all he said was 'take it out on your airline'. $250 of skincare down the drain, a damaged bag, dinner expense, taxi expense, and a lot of time and energy, additional pet sitting, additional days off work, additional parking charges at airport, and a sh*tty end to a honeymoon vacation equals roughly $1200 that we probably won't see even though I've made a claim.",1.0,London,Seattle,International,October 2024,3.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,3.0

BA stated our flight was cancelled not delayed due to adverse weather.
However, the following to flights from Heathrow to Belfast City departed albeit delayed. Seats were selling on their website for £200+ but we weren’t offered these.

"Will never fly with British Airways again. Our 12 hour flight to Mauritius was horrendous. I’ve never experienced such a tightly packed flight. Seats are too close together, no leg room and when the person in front has their seat reclined back you’re literally pinned down. Felt very claustrophobic. Virtually impossible to eat the meal as no elbow room either because of passengers so close either side.  I would say we were treated like cattle but I would hope animals are treated better! 

The cabin crew were rude, inattentive and irritable. The food was inedible, mush, not suitable for human consumption.  The cabin crew manager / shift leader spilled red wine all over my daughter’s cream joggers. We were told she would log the incident so that we could get the item dry cleaned.  We followed the procedure she told us to but she didn’t log it so we were told nothing could be done.

I explained that I need an aisle seat because I have torn meniscus in both knees, and my knees lock on me if I do not frequently change positions.  A middle seat on a full airline would mean inconveniencing other passengers.  The BA agent responded, because I did not register as a passenger with a disability, I would have to deal with it.  As I begged her for accommodation, I felt as though she paid me over $1000 to fly 9-hours over the Atlantic Ocean, and not the other way around.  I always select an aisle seat because it is the accommodation that I need, so I have never registered as a passenger needing assistance.

"Our BA249 flight from London to Rio de Janeiro was the worst experience we’ve ever had. We are a family, and due to the paid seat selection system, we couldn’t sit together, which is extremely uncomfortable when travelling with a child. During dinner, our entire row was simply ignored. Everyone around us was served food, while my child had to watch, hungry. We spoke to the flight attendants several times, but they made us wait. When the food finally arrived, the crew seemed disorganized, like it was an auction, even though we had paid nearly R$10,000 for the tickets. We weren’t given any meal choices, and my child and I had to swap plates with other passengers.

When the chief flight attendant came to speak with us, instead of addressing my complaint, he touched my shoulder and said I was 'fine,' dismissing my concerns. However, British passengers repeatedly asked if there was anything more they could do to improve the experience. In addition, there weren’t enough headphones for several passengers in our row, and the woman next to me didn’t receive a blanket even though she was freezing.

"British Airways, your service is beyond unacceptable. What was once considered a premium airline has now fallen far behind the budget carriers, who, quite frankly, are leagues ahead of you in every possible way.

My Friday morning flight from London to Berlin? Cancelled. Your brilliant response? Rebooking me on a flight on *Saturday night*. I had to be in Berlin by Friday afternoon, so instead of doing your job, I had to take matters into my own hands and book with another airline to Hamburg, followed by a train to Berlin. Completely avoidable if BA could manage basic operations like the 'cheaper' competitors do without issue.

But the nightmare doesn’t stop there. My wife—who had been training for six months to run the Berlin Marathon on Sunday—was also flying in from London later that Friday. Guess what? You cancelled her flight too. The excuse? 'Bad weather.' Really, BA? Every other airline was flying normally out of London that day. It’s embarrassing that the so-called “national carrier” of the UK couldn’t figure out what all the budget airlines did—how to keep planes in the air. 

And to add insult to injury, the flight you rebooked me on for Saturday night—after I had already spent hundreds of pounds rebooking with a competitor—was *also* cancelled. Three flights cancelled in two days. It’s honestly a joke at this point. How can you not be ashamed to call this “service”?

The return flight? Delayed by two hours. Sure, at this point, that feels minor compared to the disaster of the outbound leg, but of course, you couldn’t leave it there. We finally land at Heathrow only to wait *95 minutes* for our luggage. Almost an hour and a half standing around after everything else you put us through.

And as if that wasn't enough, I spent 40 minutes on Saturday trying to get my refund sorted out over the phone, but BA was “too busy” to even pick up. It's incredible that for all your talk of being a premium airline, you can’t even provide basic customer service when it matters.

British Airways, you should be embarrassed. Budget airlines like easyJet and Ryanair are running circles around you in terms of reliability and customer care. If this is the “flagship” of British aviation, you’re in serious trouble. Get it together, or you’ll have no passengers left to cancel flights on.

Firstly the leg room was a joke, our plane got delayed two hours and 30 minutes and bristish airways decided to tell us this last minute issue when everyone was boarded, during this delay they did not hand out anything complimentary apart half a cup of water. 

The women next to me got her plane ticket downgraded from business to economy and told us she used to work for British airways and all they did was give her a voucher not telling her how much was on the card as she told them she knows she not getting a full refund back. 

My connection flight was missed, they couldn’t put me back on the plane for the same day so I had to take expenses out and miss events the very next day. 

Getting my own money and REFUND out of them is like getting blood out a stone. British airways is full of broken promises when it comes to ‘refunds’. Everything is online and you can’t speak to a real person even though they tell you to leave your phone number.

"Absolutely shocking service from British airways. We were due to fly to Dallas from phoenix and then from phoenix to Heathrow in the UK, we had paid for business class flights. Our flights were then cancelled due to the bad weather that Dallas was having. The alternative flights they provided were for us to fly from phoenix to Las Vegas, and then from Las Vegas to Gatwick UK. The alternative flights didn’t state if we were going to be provided with our business class seats but we accepted the change due to needing to get home. When we arrived at phoenix airport we were told that as it was American Airlines that were flying us to Las Vegas they were not able to confirm if we were flying business class back to Gatwick on the British airways plane. We were advised to speak to someone on the BA desk once we had arrived in Vegas. Once we arrived we immediately asked the front desk if our business class seats were available. The lady at the desk told us they don’t do business class seats flying out from Vegas even though the business class lounge was right behind us. I am a nervous flyer so we also paid to sit together. The lady at the desk said we were going to be put in economy and none of us could sit together. I then looked up online and saw that they had business class flights the next day from Vegas going back to Heathrow, it also stated that they should provide the next available business class seats to us when needing to cancel our flights which they didn’t. When I showed the front desk the alternative flights they said there wasn’t anything they could do and were not able to change our flights to an alternative day. At this point we had about 20 mins until the plane was going to leave. We tried ringing through to British Airways who also said as we accepted the flight there wasn’t anything they could do, but said we could submit a claim online to get our money back. The lady at the desk also assured us that we were able to get a full refund on our flights home. We reluctantly boarded the plane but had to sit apart from each other.As we boarded I saw the business class seats in front of us, so the front desk completely lied to us. They also had small children split up from their parents on the plane as well. We landed back at Gatwick, even though we flew from Heathrow. Luckily we didn’t have a car at Heathrow. We then submitted a claim online and after weeks of them saying they were looking into it, they told us we were not due any compensation. Since then we have called up BA which was a complete waste of time since they said they can’t help over the phone and said we needed to submit another claim, we are still waiting and it is now almost October when we flew back the beginning of June. Not only are British airways a waste of time, they have no care for their customers what so ever, they have no respect for the passengers that have paid a premium to fly with them, and they have incompetent staff who don’t even know what sort of flights fly out from Las Vegas.

After cancelling my flight without explanation, British Airways continued to send me on airport pursuits to retrieve luggage, get rebooked, and arrange for overnight accommodations for a flight rebooked the following day.  The Ibis  hotel I was booked at was so austere, and poorly managed with hundreds of inconvenienced passengers trying to board buses, get meals and rooms that I did not manage to get a room until after meal service ended.  I was exhausted and dehydrated having flown overseas the night before.  No one apologized to me, and the customer service was beyond bad!    I spent a miserable night.  The same poor communication from British Airways caused me to miss my flight home today.  This time, I was offered a nicer hotel but it is still packed with many unhappy passengers of British Airways.  I had to ask the customer service agent who was helping me, how does British Airways manage to stay in business?  I think I know.  They clearly feel the only customers entitled to customer service or the ones who pay for premium travel.

"Despite paying cash for Business class on a round-trip flight, we were required to pay an extra $600 if we wanted to select seats. When we paid for selecting seats on a short Economy class flight in Europe, we were not seated in the seats we reserved and, in fact, my wife and I were seated in separate aisles. The automated bag drop system at Heathrow did not work for over 25% of the passengers, and they'd assigned only one overworked agent to help us all. Two of our four flights were delayed but this was not posted. Instead, no boarding gate was listed until just before or even after the departure time and left loads of passengers running for gates that had no plane waiting. There were even more problems but you get the picture.  I will add that the flight attendants aboard the flights were great: friendly, informative and assertively helpful.  However,  the online and airport-based automated services are the most frustrating and misleading that I have ever experienced. And, the phone queues for addressing the seat selection issue were so long that we couldn't even get into line. We tried to address this online but the BA website would not let us continue until we listed the case number, even though they'd not provided a case number.",1.0,Seattle,London,International,September 2024,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,4.0

"We chose BA because of the direct flight on the day we needed to travel.
The flight we had originally booked had been cancelled a couple of months before, so we had to change to a later afternoon flight. Fitting this in with other arrangements meant that we got to the airport quite early (and there is nowhere to leave luggage in Terminal 1 before check-in). This meant we spent quite a lot of time 'landside' at the airport with our suitcases in tow ... Unfortunately, BA's check-in at Nice Airport didn't open until exactly 2 hours before departure, and quite a long queue had already formed by then.  (It looked like quite a nice airport once 'airside', but we didn't have much time to appreciate it!)
Returning from a short break, we wanted seats together but didn't want to spend the last afternoon of our holiday worrying about doing online check-in 24 hours before departure, so we had pre-booked seats at an extra cost of £36 (£18 per seat).
Regarding the flight itself, most importantly, it ran to time. The First Officer gave information en route (about our flight, routing, destination weather etc.) which I always find interesting.
The aircraft interior was OK, although there were crumbs on my seat.
The cabin crew were pleasant. We managed to find room for our (modestly-sized, soft) hand luggage items in the overhead lockers. (They had been encouraging people with trolley bags to check them in for free as the flight was full.) 
We had pre-booked (pre-paid) for 'Time for Tea' boxes, which were delivered to our seat early in the flight, and consisted of a fruit scone with little pots of strawberry jam and clotted cream and a little chocolate fudge cake bite - Very nice!",3.0,Nice,London,Europe,September 2024,3.0,4.0,N/A,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0

"I booked Hannover - London - Shanghai and the same way back, Premium Economy.
Flight to China:
Our flight from Hannover to London was cancelled and then rebooked to the same flight on the next day. But the flight (Hannover - London) was delayed and we missed the flight London to Shanghai. They rebooked us to China Eastern but economy class. 2 months later I still don't have any compensation from BA about my 'downgrade'

Return flight:
BA simply cancelled out flight on our way back. With no rebook opportunity. Is it really right? We all know that it's cheaper to book return ticket. And I got half of my money back but I had to pay more to buy a one way ticket in ordered to come back to Europe.

Guess for my family, 2 adults and 2 kids, how much we paid for our new ticket (Shanghai - Istanbul - Hannover, one way)? 4000 Euro.

Not every family can pay 4000 Euro for a flight ticket immediately.

"I am so disappointed in the poor treatment my husband and I received from British Airways staff in Barcelona. They were unfriendly at best, deliberately unhelpful and sabotaging at worst. We arrived at 1000, and our flight to London left at 1310. (Our final destination was in the U.S.) At  the check-in desk, there was a different flight number from ours on the board. I asked the BA staff member at the desk, and she said we couldn’t check-in for our flight until 1145. I asked her twice because that didn’t seem enough time, and she answered the same and stomped off. We waited around the area checking to see if the flight number on the board would change. By 1145 it hadn’t, so we asked another staff member there who said that we needed to check in now because our flight was boarding soon! She also said that we hadn’t paid for baggage when we had, and when my husband went to show her the emailed receipt she had requested she didn’t look at it. It should not have been a surprise, then, that our luggage did not arrive in the U.S. when we did. The person helping us at our arrival airport thought our bags had made it to London, but not from London to the U.S. After tracing our bags with BA, we found out that the bags were still in Barcelona. We are waiting for them now to be flown to our local airport.

The two flights were not as smooth as we have been accustomed with BA. Regarding the first flight from Barcelona to London, after landing in London passengers had to sit on the plane for about half an hour on the tarmac before we could exit the aircraft, making us nearly miss our connecting flight. When we got to the gate, we discovered that my husband and I weren’t seated together although we had paid for seat assignments. I was told this was because the aircraft had changed. Although the connecting flight boarded on time, passengers had to sit on the plane for nearly an hour before take off while, it was explained to us later, they had to fix some “technical issues” and to clear out water from the baggage compartment that had been flooded from the heavy rain. Then finally at home, of course, there were no bags. This is the fourth trip we’ve taken with BA from the U.S. to Barcelona since 2021. We have continued to book with them because of their usually excellent customer service. This trip was the worst, however, with the delays and especially due to the shabby treatment from BA staff in Barcelona.

The food was a mixed bag, the first meal was great and definitely of a higher quality I would expect in premium economy, however the second meal was much more basic and didn't even match the menu description at all except that it contained chicken! There was a 10 hour period between the 2 meals during a daytime flight, and extra food was not offered unless you asked for it. 

The recline on the seats was way too excessive, you could almost lie flat. If the person in front of you fully reclines, it is extremely difficult to get up out of your seat, making it tricky to stretch your legs or use the bathroom. This has actually put me off British Airways Premium Economy as I do not like feeling trapped in my seat for a 14 hour flight. This recline also resulted in an awkward dispute with a couple sat behind us who would not let us fully recline (which we needed to do to reclaim our space as the person in front of us was fully reclined) and a flight attendant had to get involved.

We explained these were our only pieces of hand luggage – and take up much less room in the overhead locker than the trolley bags which we could have brought – but he was adamant that trolley bags get priority.

"Flight BA2781 from Paphos (PFO) to London Gatwick (LGW) 22nd September 2024, arrived at around 12:10 a.m. After waiting at the baggage claim for at least an hour, the carousel then came to a complete stop, and still we had no luggage. We were informed by another passenger that 28 bags were not loaded onto the plane in Paphos. After locating a British Airways Agent, it transpired that the bags were not loaded onto the plane due to weight/loading imbalance and that we needed to go to the GGS desk to complete a form. Our bags, along with 26 others, were INTENTIONALLY not put on our flight.  The most frustrating thing was that we were not kept informed and there was a complete lack of communication from British Airways.  This could easily have been rectified if BA had let us know the minute we landed. Why didn’t they?  These bags were left behind on purpose and were NOT lost or mislaid. They were deliberately not put on the aircraft. I have a hard time believing that a plane cannot accommodate the luggage for the passengers on the plane. My guess is their priority is delivering mail or other cargo that takes priority over passengers, unless BA can provide a legitimate and detailed explanation to the contrary? I understand that these things can happen, but it is how they are handled that makes the difference. With today’s communication abilities, British Airways could easily have left a message at the carousel so that we could start the form-filling in process immediately instead of waiting for nearly an hour in the early hours of the morning for bags that were clearly not going to arrive.

It was accompanied by what I think was a rounded white blob of (?) crème fraiche with some form of fruit splodge and topped off with a lukewarm mug of tasteless tea. I left it all.

We watched as everyone else walked onboard and then were finally told that we could board. Crappy, uncomfortable seats… Of course, on arrival, our hold baggage wasn’t on our flight- so we had to wait another hour for it to arrive, delaying our start to the holiday. 

Worst customer service experience in my 40 years including many long hauls of travel. An absolute insult which I will NEVER forget. Sort yourselves out BA, or do us a favour and remove the ‘British’ from your name, you’re an embarrassment.

"What an absolute disaster of a trip. I have flown 100+ times in my life, and this was by far the worst experience I have ever had. If you want the full details, keep reading. If you're looking for a synopsis: don't fly British Airways if you want stress-free travel.

First flight from BCN to LHR:
We got to the airport at 7:30am, only to be greeted by a 2-hour line for baggage check-in, at least 30 minutes of which was a complete standstill because there was not a single person at the check-in desk. Our flight ended up being delayed about an hour due to weather, which I totally understand is out of their control. However, when we finally got on the plane, the captain came on saying they had to rearrange the bags to meet the weight distribution requirements. That took about 20 minutes, but it then pushed us back about 40 minutes due to all the traffic leaving the airport. If it were only for that, we probably would have made our connecting flight to Denver. But of course, we also had to wait 40 minutes upon landing for a gate to become available. 

Stuck in London:
Once we got off the plane, we had to go to 3 different desks just to find out where we would be staying for the night. The third desk had a wait of around 2 hours before we were told we didn't even need to wait in it. The customer service agent pulled us from the line and told us to wait aside while he got us our hotel/shuttle vouchers. Even though we paid thousands of dollars for premium economy seats, we got put up in a budget hotel that goes for 60 pounds per night - the room didn't even have outlets. We were also told that we wouldn't be getting our luggage unless we waited another 2 hours at baggage claim. After 6 hours of waiting throughout the day, we decided to skip that and go to the hotel with just our carry-ons. 

LHR to DIA:
When we got to LHR, we had a much smoother time checking in. However, my husband and I were randomly assigned seats away from each other, even though we had booked together and paid for seats together on the original flight (what a way to end our honeymoon, right?). We talked to customer service, and were told there was nothing they could do. We got lucky enough to talk to a manager, and were personally escorted to the lounge to relax and enjoy a halfway decent breakfast before a long day of travel. We were told to speak to the gate agent to see about moving seats, so we did that as soon as we got to the gate. Once again, we were told there was nothing they could do. Luckily, my husband was sat next to a kind stranger that allowed me to switch seats with her. The flight itself went relatively smooth, other than the medical emergency someone had in business class, and we touched down a little earlier than expected. Due to the medical emergency, we were able to get directly to a gate upon landing. Once we got through customs after landing, we waited over an hour to get our luggage. At that point, I had never been happier to get home.

Long story short, those 48 hours between all the flights was a nightmare, and I will never fly British Airways again. That was the worst possible way to end a honeymoon, and a piss poor job by the airline in solving any of the issues we encountered.",1.0,Barcelona,Denver,International,September 2024,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,4.0

My wife and I took this rearranged flight after our original flight was cancelled last minute on the 11th September due to Hurricane Francine. We boarded as normal as the flight was showing as on time 12/09/24 at approximately 15.30 for a 16.05 scheduled departure. When seated and the cabin door closed we were advised that there would be a delay as air freight had to be removed to make way for more fuel! The delay turned into 2 hours 30 minutes before we backed off the stand and 3 hours by the time we took off. Throughout the flight no hot drinks were served. We were subjected to mediocre baked cod for dinner and an excuse for a pre-landing snack of a 'Savory Pastry' which was nothing short of a culinary abomination and couldn't be consumed. When we finally arrived at MSY we were held in the aircraft a further 40 minutes before disembarkation (apparently due to a cargo issue) a total of 14 hours  or more without so much as an apology. When a fellow passenger made her thoughts known to a member of the crew she was bluntly told that 'it isn't our fault'. I would just like to say it most definitely wasn't our fault as paying customers. We had accepted that our holiday had been shortened by a day because of the Hurricane but in no way should we have experienced such a shambles.

"I have never been so neglected and disrespected by a company like this.

On September 18, I had a flight from Paris to São Paulo with a layover at Heathrow in London with British Airways. This flight was delayed by almost an hour due to technical problems. When we finally landed in London, I was informed that I could no longer board and that I was being transferred to a flight at 8 PM the next day. My luggage was checked, including my carry-on that I checked at the insistence of the airline. 

I begged for an earlier flight since I couldn't afford to spend a day in London and needed to return to Brazil for work. The best they could do for me was arrange a flight at 6 AM with Air France. I still had to spend the night in London; there were no last-minute hotels within my budget available, and the airline refused to book one for me or provide any assistance. I had to sleep in the airport, without food or help.

When I finally boarded the Air France flight, I asked about my luggage and was assured that everything would be fine upon arriving in Brazil. When I arrived in Brazil, my two bags were left in Paris, along with all my belongings and work items. Now their website is down, I have been completely harmed, and I have received no support so far. 

It was a total nightmare; it was my first trip to Europe, and I never imagined I would be so traumatized.",1.0,Paris,Sao Paulo,International,September 2024,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0

"Never again with BA! 
We booked Las Vegas with BA as neither of us had flown with them before and thought they had a good rep. How wrong.
Checking in at Vegas airport and we were told our suitcases (the same 2 with brought from London to Vegas 4 days earlier no problem) were not paid for. I tried to show her but the app, as I have discovered over the passed few months, was down. She would not let us check in until we paid and said we could claim it back. She was abrupt and would not let me talk. As we were paying, the app reloaded and, as I had said, 2 bags confirmed on there. 
She went to get her supervisor. She said to her “I told her show me proof and she wouldn’t”. I explained again about the app but why, if on my phone, is it not on their screen? Her reply? “When you book the cheap seats, it doesn’t always go into our system and the app is having ongoing technical issues”. Cheap seats? Yes, economy but not the cheapest we found. 
By this time my husband had paid for one by card (they wanted £75 per suitcase). We asked for refund and nope! You have to put in a claim request and “if” agreed then they would sort a refund!
We get through to board, they keep tannoying for passengers that have come through to departures but not been security checked! Announce this over and over saying they won’t board until they go through passport control and security. 
We get on board on time. Then we are told there is a 10 mins delay as there is are discrepancies with luggage. 2.5 hours later, with no offer of a drink or checking on anyone, we see from our window, all the luggage units being REMOVED from the plane. The captain comes on and says prepare for take off! A lady pointed out the luggage was removed to a flight attendant. She says “oh really, I’ll let the captain know”. 
We then Have the quickest taxi to take off. No update.
During flight, offered one hot drink. It was overnight. My husband and I fell asleep and another attendant wakes us by pulling off my husbands blanket and asking to see his seatbelt! The same woman comes towards the end of the flight, before the announcement to put up chair backs, etc and leans over me to sit me up, pushing my chair forward and pulling off the blanket to check my belt! She then does the same to the lady in front. Man handled. Then the announcement comes to get ready for landing.
Also, both out there and back the flight was very cold-so much so I bought a tracksuit from H&M in Vegas worrying it would be so cold again, and it was! 

We land and receive the following;

“ BA2276 - We're really sorry you have had to leave the airport without your bags after your recent flight with us. We'll do our best to reunite them with you as soon as possible. To enable us to do this quickly, we need you to complete a baggage report form online. Please complete a form at ba.com/helpme. You'll receive a tracking number and we'll be in touch to arrange the delivery of your bags”

I’m sorry?! Followed by an email saying to complete a form online or go to a desk in arrivals. 
One flight attendant was heard saying “the cats out the bag, they all know now”. So staff on board were well aware and still did nothing to better the flight. 
Lots of people chose online and left. We went to the desk only to be told, if you fill out online it could be “weeks” as the forms at the airport are declarations of goods so without them the bags take much longer to process!
Luckily we had gone to fill out.
Whilst there, a passenger who used to work for BA said they will have been told to depart before we were all delayed over 3 hours as everyone would be entitled to compensation. So they would have chose to leave without the bags to save money! 
We now have to wait for our bags to be delivered home. They have been diverted to Heathrow! 
Just to add insult, we all asked to speak to a BA rep at Gatwick and was told there are none as they are only in Heathrow! 
I am not hopeful of a decent outcome or customer service experience reading the reviews!

12 hour delay was tough. We should have arrived Tenerife in the morning but end up arrived nearly midnight. Tried to contact British Airways but they cut us off. Tried to refund but no answer tho. 

By the way, our flight was changed departure time and aircraft type a few times before departure date. Ruined our extra legroom seats we paid.

We still have one more trip to Gran Canaria with them in thw next few months but they just cancelled our afternoon flight from Gran Canaria to Gatwick and combined with evening flight so we'll be arriving Gatwick 23.00 something.

"Travelling as a family group with 2  children , under 2. My son in law had booked flights months ago 6 months +)and one of the children had been born since that point so we had to add as an infant linked to our booking.  
We logged on to discover the seats we had carefully booked at time of booking had been changed on way out. 
After trying to check in and getting error messages, a further long phone call we were assured that everything was ok and sorted.  Arrived at Heathrow, luckily, with 3 hrs to spare and spend an hour and half trying to check in!  As you can imagine trying to do this with an active toddler and baby was very stressful.  The checkin needed to call the help desk to sort - in India and had to wait in queue.  Must of been at least 4 calls , we asked for a supervisor who eventually turned up over an hour in. He seems more concerned that the check in person was at end of shift and should stop and pass us on to a new person - the implication was that we would have to join queue and start all over again!  We, by now, had 2 very hungry and gross children, tantrums in offing so we kade it quite clear that wasn't going to be an option. Supervisor eventually settled down to sort it out but also seemed confused how to do this!  
We eventually got our boarding passes but by now the careful plan to get though security and give the toddler a hot meal (also the rest of group as we had had a two hour trip to get to airport) and feed to baby had fallen to pieces and we had a full hangry toddler tantrum while rushing to get to gate. We had plenty of snacks but this was definitely not the calm first flight for the toddler we had planned.
We have now tried to check in for return and discovered all our booked seats have been cancelled and no room to sit together. In fact this time the toddler has a seat and at this point only option was to be all separate and also error messages trying to check in with baby- not feasible with 2 young children .   Another long long phone call and we hope it has been sorted.  We are not very very stressed about it, now planning to get to airport very very early again in case, ruining the last few days of our long planned family holiday. 
Our last trip, about 18 months ago just as a couple, was on BA as part of a package trip, was marred by arriving at gate to be informed we had been moved from our pre booked, paid for leg room seats.  Told it was due to chafe of plane Gate staff were rude and we were dumped in mid plan seats but we checked the layout and it was identical and walked back to see a group of adults in our pre booked seats, (if it had been young children then that is more acceptable but having traveled extensively with 3 young children, we always planned, booked seats etc well ahead of time) 
Sorry BA but having always traveled with you on business and leisure years ago but then changed to better offering, we did come back to see if things have changed but they haven't!

No water was offered during the flight, we sat in the extra leg room seats, near the toilets, in general, nothing wrong with the actual seats, it was just the service.
We got our meals 30 minutes after the row, next to us, got theirs, we were the last to be served, I understand someone has to be last but there seemed to be no logic to service! 
The group next to us, had no dietary requirements but got 4 drinks and were offered another breakfast, as they cleared their trays….. this resulted in them being offered another breakfast, before we got ours! 
Poor selection of food…. Dinner was a chicken curry and a moose with drink.
Breakfast was an English, but sausage was poor quality, egg was so over cooked by the time we got it! Was inedible, yogurt, small pot of fruit and small water.

"Flew out on a Tuesday in early September – BA 1416 – early afternoon departure – pre-printed boarding passes – fast track security – tried North Lounge first of all – it was full – and then walked to the South and found a couple of seats – lite sandwich lunch with some fizz – and then the long walk back to the departure gate just below the North Lounge – A319 – 23 years old – on-time departure – seats 1D+F at the front – afternoon tea – fruity scone  clotted cream and jam plus a cuppa – just the job – uneventful flight - first off – no checked-in luggage so no delay.

BA 1423 – a return flight a week – 09.45 departure – loaded boarding passes on mobiles and it was through security to lounge. 

BA use Aspire Lounge – big space next to Gate 4 – some cooked breakfast items – yoghurts – a sort of fruit salad – hot and cold drinks and alcohol. 

When called to board we went through a separate door for Club Europe passengers directly from the lounge – final checks of boarding passes and identification – and then it was straight onto the awaiting plane. 

A320 – 16 years old – warm welcome – seated – 3D+F – all boarded ahead of time – 09.30 - then the problems started – we were informed that because of issues at Heathrow the flight deck were being advised on an hour’s delay – this was cut down to around 25 minutes – pushed back and taxied to depart – another announcement – a further delay and with inbound aircraft we had to leave our position – taxied down the runway past our gate and back to the holding area at the end of the runway – cleared and we left in a hurry.

Food service – choice of full english, omelette or cold meats – hot drinks – alcohol – at this point the champagne began to flow.

Just before descent we were informed of further delays and a 25-minute stack over Bovingdon – eventually we landed just after 12.00 having been fully boarded by 09.30 in Belfast – not BA’s fault – in fact they came out of it reasonably well – they kept us informed throughout the flight – and at the front our cabin crew continued to be cheerful.

I never used to be a great fan of BA but our recent experiences with the website the call centre by email on the ground and in the air, I am beginning to revise my opinion of them.

"Travelled on this flight on Saturday 14th September 2024. Cabin crew aside from one of the three personnel on duty in the economy class cabin on the specific flight, were really quite disappointing. Brash and looked really vexed every time a passenger tried to alert their attention and they were really not engaged at all during the trolley service etc., If anything they even seemed angry for being on duty on the specific flight. They were even quite abrupt when addressing passengers and this is quite unnerving especially since they do not know in what line of work a passenger may be in, for example they may even be British Airways staff on holiday, or staff from another airline, and hence, having a benchmark and a modicum of how service in the cabin should be. Thankfully, only travel British Airways if it is the only direct airline option available. 

British Airways has truly reached the bottom of the barrel and it is indeed quite strange that instead of striving to improve their product and augment their overall holistic travel experience, they prefer to kow-tow to greedy shareholders who wish to become even more gluttonous at the expense of the public and fare-paying passenger. Why British Airways has decided to move along the path of the lowest common denominator is truly perplexing. 

In order for an airline to improve and for smiles to return, try paying your staff throughout the airline irrespective of job role a far better salary instead of putting monies earned into the pockets of greedy shareholders who are basically interested in asset stripping and in filling their pockets!",2.0,Valencia,London,Europe,September 2024,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0
"Return flight to LHR from SFO in business class on a 777-300.

Boarding and lounge access at SFO could not be faulted, food, beverage and service was good.  You boarded direct from lounge area, which was a bonus.  The flight was an hour late departing due to a delayed inward flight.  

The flight was good and the seat in Club comfortable.  The food was not a big issue as I only picked at it as it was a red eye and the priority was sleep.  I picked at the food, watched a movie and bedded down, thankfully I managed to get a good 5/6 hrs sleep.

The crew were good and responsive, providing drink when required.  Breakfast was refreshing as I only ate the fruit and had the juice followed with an Earl Grey.  Could not be faulted.

The low mark for the review, came again as the BA ground crew could not get their act together, it seems to happen all the time now.  Although we were an hour delayed in take-off, the air crew managed to make up the time and even though we were stacked for a while waiting to drop into LHR we were only a few minutes late in arrival.  Unfortunately, the gate we were allocated was blocked with a plane and we had to wait a long time around T3.  When we finally exited the plane we flew through security, such a breeze.

"Just reading all reviews of BA - agree absolutely- the worst airline ever! Travelling back to the UK at the end of June/beginning of July - Our flight from Venice was cancelled 10 minutes before boarding- only explanation given initially was “bad weather” - there was no bad weather at the time in Europe then that changed to “technical issues “ - really!!!? As our baggage had already been loaded we had to reclaim it - no assistance was given - it was pandemonium.
We were given a return flight the following morning with a 10.00 am departure.
We were bussed to a nearby hotel for an overnight stay and promised a return coach the following morning back to the airport. Next morning - no coach! Had to get a taxi back to the airport 
The check in was absolute chaos and took forever. We were lucky to get on the flight in time.

"British Airways—A National Disgrace
On 5 September 2024, my wife and I were scheduled to fly British Airways from Edinburgh to London Heathrow at 8:25 PM. Without warning or apology, we received a curt email around 5 PM informing us that our flight had been canceled. No explanation, no alternative offered—just a cold notice, as if we were an afterthought. We headed to the airport anyway, holding on to the faint hope that British Airways might actually manage to salvage the situation. That hope was soon dashed when, after several delays, the replacement flight they rebooked for 9:10 PM was canceled as well. 

From there, things went from bad to worse. British Airways’ ground crew, showing an appalling lack of compassion and professionalism, told us to either find a hotel on our own or take a taxi to Glasgow or London—a seven-hour journey by car! The audacity of suggesting passengers fend for themselves at 2 AM in a foreign city is beyond negligent; it’s callous. Then, to make matters worse, they simply left—abandoned us without a care in the world. At that point, British Airways stopped being a service provider and became a disgrace to its name and nation.

We had no functioning WiFi, as the airport’s connection was limited to texting, so even contacting hotels or making alternative arrangements was near impossible. After hours of being left in the lurch, we finally retrieved our luggage around 4 AM and checked in again at 5 AM for a 10:30 AM flight. We eventually arrived at our London hotel at 2 PM—16 hours later than originally planned—only to be slapped with a 'No Show' charge for the previous night, which British Airways caused by failing to get us there.

During our eventual flight on 6 September, I recounted this horrific ordeal to a flight attendant, who at least had the decency to pass our information to Customer Service and advised us to file a claim. We attempted to do so, but British Airways’ intentionally convoluted claims system is a bureaucratic nightmare, clearly designed to frustrate passengers into giving up. And after finally gathering the courage to submit our claim upon returning to the USA, we received a heartless, dismissive response: 'Your claim for compensation has been refused because BA1463 on 5 September was canceled due to restrictions imposed by Air Traffic Control for adverse weather conditions.'

British Airways, where exactly should I seek compensation? Should I go to Air Traffic Control? Or, as your refusal implicitly suggests, should I take my case to the Almighty God, who presumably caused the weather at Heathrow? 

What a cruel, absurd excuse. As we sat stranded, we watched multiple planes from Heathrow land in Edinburgh. Was there adverse weather at Heathrow? Possibly, for a short time. But for you to hide behind “bad weather” as if it paralyzed the entire airport for the entire night is insulting and dishonest.

British Airways, you are not just an airline—you are a shameful stain on the country you claim to represent. Your negligence, lack of humanity, and complete disregard for stranded passengers make you a disgrace to your industry and your nation. You failed to provide us with even the most basic decency: no meal vouchers, no accommodation, and no assistance of any kind. You abandoned us in the dead of night, and now you refuse to refund the money we lost because of your incompetence.

The public should be fully aware of the utter indifference you show to those unfortunate enough to fly with you. British Airways, you claim passengers must seek compensation from God, but tragically, God doesn’t pay refunds.",1.0,Edinburgh,London,Domestic,September 2024,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
"Absolutely awful customer service with BA. I specifically booked directly with BA to avoid any problems that could occur from booking through a travel agent. Little did I know.

We were then kept on the plane for 40 minutes and told we couldn't have any of our checked baggage and this was locked away in the airport while the flight was suspended until the next day. When we boarded the plane the expected landing time was after midnight which begs the question: why did they even board us and check our cabin bags?

"Terminal 5…

We are not home as I write this but in a Hilton Hotel room at Boston airport ($313 for one night). I can just visualize a dapper, well scrubbed insufferably polite British Airways spokesperson saying that although they, naturally, sympathize with our plight they are “terribly sorry but such an expense hasn’t been authorised by BA and unfortunately their hands are tied” or something similarly smarmy and unctuous.

What happened:
There were thunderstorms in London Friday morning a week ago, September 6, 2024, slowing down all incoming flights. When we arrived to the airport from Flixton to MANchester (our taxi was forty minutes late picking us up) the line at checkin was massive, completely filling the registration or checkin hall. Two attendants. TWO. 

We were in line with a couple of hundred of other people. 

All outgoing flights to London had been delayed for hours, even at that point, at about 09:00 for a scheduled 10:30 departure. Our shuttle flight, when eventually called, sat on the tarmac for a further half an hour or more, no ventilation (but free water and nuts)… then, when we arrived at LHR, we were too late to catch our scheduled 1:30pm flight to PHL, so, again, we joined hundreds of people, if not thousands, who were connecting through LHR for ongoing journeys and they were all in the same boat as us. 

The sky was very threatening looking, surely, and departing flights disappeared into the low clouds almost instantly, like they were entering the Twilight Zone. All sorts of flights were being delayed… left and right… but not the one we needed, to Philly… apparently that one left at 1:30, ON TIME…so we missed it. Then, we were called out by a Brit Air employee who put us on another BA flight, but to Boston, leaving at 6pm local time. 

They gave us connecting tickets for PHL, to depart Boston at 9:30 Eastern time Friday night, arriving maybe 10:30pm instead of 4:30pm, but yes, that one from LHR was delayed too, and yes, I went to get some food.

But, even with all the downtime bestowed on us by Brit Air, once more we didn’t have yet enough time to clear customs in Boston Terminal E and then move to the far side of the airport, on foot, to catch the Philly flight. 

The British airways people could’ve put us on a different carrier, say American, or Delta, or any other airline serving the eastern United States from London Heathrow but no, they put us on a British Airways flight …even though it did exactly no good and left us stranded in Boston, at a closed airport, with no luggage, and no place to sleep. We had to pay for a room at the airport and caught the earliest flight the next morning. 

I’m assuming British Airways did this so they wouldn’t have to share any of the profits on our ticket sales with their partners by putting us on a flight to our actual destination city.

The US Homeland Security man at Boston was friendly as he examined our passports, asking if we had a nice time, etc., but he also said we would need to claim our luggage here, at Boston, go through customs, and then recheck it in for our ongoing connection, and then get all the way over to Terminal A. So As it turns out we also had to go through baggage claim in Boston and we waited at the carousel for an additional half hour …until everybody else had left. 

Yes, i asked a BA ground representative, and after checking a digital manifest said our bags were not on the list, and she said our bags were ‘probably’ never loaded onto the Boston plane in London after all, and to take it up with BA at our PHL destination, so then we left the terminal without baggage, to take the free shuttle to the far terminal in the strange airport, but there was no time to wait so Cindy wanted to RUN there to Terminal B from Terminal E. I, of course, couldn’t hardly walk, never mind run. She ended up pushing me at least half a mile in a wheelchair …fast-walking or even running…but when we got to the deserted American Airlines desk (actually located in Terminal B, not Terminal A) we were told that the flight had gone without us and there was not another until 07:00 today, Saturday. Right now i am standing in the hotel bathroom at the sink, typing this at 02:11 am. I have no clean clothes, no clean socks, teeshirt, no toothbrush, no razor, no medications. I had run out of those anyway, even the spare ones.

We have an early wakeup call for 04:30 and will depart the Hilton in THEIR shuttle bus in plenty of time to make that flight, which starts boarding at 06:40 am.

So that is what happened.

O the joys of airline travel.

"Stay far far far away from British Airlines (BA).   Our flight from london to JFK  was delayed due to maintaintence by two hours which made making our connecting flight tight.  While my wife and I were in flight British Airway removed us from the JFK to Norfolk flight and rebooked us on another flight at another airport in New York.   When we landed in New York I received a text msg saying that the new flight that British Airways booked us on was cancelled.

When we departed the plane a british airlines represnted met us and provide a taxi voucher to get to the other airport and bording passes.  We then informed the agent that flight was cancelled who directed us to the BA customer service.  After waiting in line for 20 minutes the BA agent said that even though they booked the flight it was throuogh American Airlines and we needed to go to their customer service.  (meanwhile our original flight from JFK to Norfolk that BA removed us from was delayed and was still at JFK and boarding passengers).

After standing in the American Airline customer service line for over an hour, the Agent their said it was a BA problem to fix.  Thankfully that agent walked us over to the BA customer service front of that line, which was very long.   We spent over an hour with the BA agent trying to find another flight home, there were no seats available on any flights.  It is at this time we hear theh final boarding announcementfor our original flight that BA removed us from.  The BA agent was nice but couldn't flight two seats on the same flight until Monday, it is Friday evening and we have been up over 24 hours.   It was at this point I asked about a refund for the flight that we didn't take because BA removed us from it.  The agent gave us all the information about filing a claim, also stated she updated our file about the situation and how there were no flights available.   I filed a claim for that part of the trip that BA removed us from and now it is being rejected by BA stating that I have to contact American Airlines for the refund.   I paid BA for the flight, not AA.  I am still trying to get reiimbursed for the flight that BA removed me from and was unable to rebook me on a different flight to get back home. 

 BA may smile while facing you but will not have your best interest when it matters.   I will never fly with them again nor will I ever recommend them to anyone.

"For years I was a gold card holder with BA. I travelled the world with my job and insisted that whenever possible I flew BA. The reasons behind my decision was 3 fold, first because of the higher standard of training of the cabin crew, they treated everyone, no matter where you sat, with respect and always with a smile; secondly, the level of comfort on a BA flight was above many other carriers and thirdly whenever I boarded a BA flight from a foreign country I always felt, even before take off, I was almost home and, a small part of me felt as though I was back in Britain.
Obviously airlines, like any other business has to review their own business plan given changes in the market and BA have most definitely done this and they have obviously decided to operate their EU, short haul flights, as a low cost airline. The only difference being is that they have not altered their pricing structure so you get all of the things you would get on a low cost airline like cramped seating, a packet of nuts thrown at you when you are seated, no water supplied, a quick visit of a trolley to pay inflated prices for sandwiches and drinks and then the cabin crew, who really looked as though they didnt want to be there, will disappear for a couple of hours and not even come around to collect any rubbish from you. This is exactly what happened on our flight last night which, by the way was 4 hours 15 mins long. The thing that really irritated was on our approach the Cabin Service Manager made an announcement and said ' thank you cabin crew for all of your hard work tonight and would you now take your seats for landing' - what hard work, they had done very little. 
It is quite apparent that BA have decided to pull back on the standards required to become cabin crew and the training for BA cabin crew has been minimised, most probably to save money, because you now get friendly service, a more professional approach, a smile and a courteous approach from Cabin Crew on other truly low cost airlines than you do on BA. The difference is that these other low cost airlines are happy to admit what they are and explain what you get whereas BA still try to behave as though they are the proud carriers of the Union Flag colours anda re our National Carriers representing the UK around the world, when really they are worse than many carriers, they cant compete with such airlines as Emirates, Etihad, Cathay Pacific on their long haul flights and they canr compete with such airlines as EastJet or Wizz Air on their short haul. If I was in Government I would be reviewing whether or not we allow BA to carry on carrying our countries name unless they improve their standards to odffer a much better impression to visitors to our country who, at the momemnt, have the unfortunate luck of arriving here on a BA flight.
I will not be flying BA again unless I have no other option and that is what BA have done well they have kept the popular routes to Europe and blockerd other airlines getting take off slots, its as though they have a monopoly on many European routes and no one else can compete.

"Over last 10 years we have flown Biz  Sydney/ Paris on Emirates, Etihad, Qatar & Singapore. So, I am comparing an Aud$14,400 First seat flying BA to an Emirates Biz $9400 flying their A380.

To save you reading further: Fly any of the top 4 above and save yourself 10K.

Flying First was on my bucket list and on our 10th wedding anniversary it seemed the right time to splurge. In nearly every way the Emirates A380 is a better experience from boarding, service, in flight entertainment, seat space & extras like mini drinks bar, not forgetting the stand up bar, and so the list goes on...

On our flight over the Wifi & coffee machine were not working properly. On my wife's trip home the in-flight entertainment system not working at all , Singapore/ Sydney.  That's 8 hours. A lot of unhappy campers on that flight!

My check-in at Marseille (hop to London to fly back) took 1 hour. Yes 1 hour. BA Head Office had been aware of the computer glitch but failed to fix. I had to be escorted through security as they had to 'hand-print' my boarding passes. Bizarre? Yes quite, but avoidable if the company actioned issues as they come to hand.

And that's pretty much the state of affairs for BA.

The staff lovely, patient, as they try to explain away the inefficiencies (read cut-backs) within the airline.

"Worst airline ever!!  Do not fly!!!   My husband and I traveled to Paris for the summer Olympics, and had a wonderful 2 weeks in Paris, and then we headed home.  Our flight from Paris to London was delayed over an hour with no explanation whatsoever.  When we boarded the plane in Paris we told the flight crew we had a tight connection and asked if they could call over to our flight from London to Seattle and let them know we were coming.  This has been done on other flights and airlines.  There were 8 people on our flight trying to make the Seattle connection, so we thought it would be worth them doing as there were so many people on our flight, however they just told us to  ask at the customer service desk when we got off the plane.  When we landed we had about 30 mins to make our flight, however they canceled our tickets and prohibited us from even trying to get to our flight.  I would love to know if they filled those seats with other people, because I highly doubt that those seats went to Seattle empty!  

 We stood in line at the customer service desk for over an hour while our flight was delayed and still left without us. When we finally got to the head of the line we were told there were no more flights and that we were rebooked on a United flight in the morning that had an additional layover in San Francisco.   They put us up in a hotel near the airport and gave us food and bus vouchers which was fine.  However, the hotel had a wedding and dj that played floor shaking music until 1 am.  The next morning exhausted and ready to be home, we boarded a disgusting United flight to San Francisco.  These were supposed to be comparable seats but they were not!  The aircrew was rude and the plane was absolutely filthy!  Because we had an extra stop in the US we had to pick up our bags and go through customs and recheck them in San Francisco.  When we finally got to Seattle a day late our bags were no where to be found.  So much so that the airlines didn’t even know where they were.  It took three days for our bags to be found and another two days to get them. 

 When I called British Airways to talk about compensation and complain I was told there wasn’t a department for that, you have to fill out and online form and they will get back to me in less then 30 days.  So I filled out the online form and three weeks later I got an email saying that the flight was delayed due to air traffic control and so we were not entitled to any sort of compensation.  It’s awfully convenient that on their website they list air traffic control as a reason for no compensation. 

This was a form email no personalized, no contact information, nothing!  If you want to follow up or add anything you have to go online and fill out the form again and wait for another form email.  Which I did with the same result a form email with no personalization.  I honestly don’t think anymore even looks at the forms when they are submitted because the response didn’t even address what I put in the complaint.

BA say this is because weight restrictions on their small planes mean they can't fly safely in many weather conditions because of fuel usage. In fact they can by adding more fuel, but this affects profit so easier to remove passengers. Of course it is buried in terms and conditions, but never made clear up front.

Staff tried to help and admit it happens routinely, even when weather appears OK.

TIP. Do not fly BA from London  City airport as you definitely risk being bumped off flight.

"What didn't BA do wrong in our 4 flights with them last month? First we had a seat we had to buy for my wife's wedding dress (per their website FAQ), that took 20 phone calls at an hour a piece to even get because the people on the phone have no clue how to set that up, but then we get on the flight and the seat was gone. We're over a month since the flight and the official complaint that was put in via the flight crew, and all we've gotten from that is a generic form response. No money, no actual legit response yet.

Then there was trying to come home and our first flight out of Dublin was indefinitely delayed, and we ended up missing our connecting flight. We get stuck in London for a night with no bags, and then have to fly to Paris to be able to get home (not even home, but IAD because BA stopped flights to BWI during the time we were there). Then, it took almost a week after we got home for all our bags to show up (hey, at least they showed up). Still crickets on that complaint too.

This was all after we had to extend our trip a day because BA cancelled the BWI flights and couldn't get us home to even IAD that day.

"Well. 
Firstly the app.

 Horrendous. It usually returns a response of ‘we are experiencing a high demand at the moment - please try later’. Really! Try and pre-book extra luggage on the app prior to 24 hours. Good luck to you. 

Why do other airlines offer more than 24 hours to check in but BA do not? This is a huge question

Good luck to you when you fly BA to only find out that you are ‘sub contracted’ to  Iberian airlines or another. You need a degree and a miracle to find out hope to check in and who to do it through. You go to BA and then find you are transferred to another airline who does not recognise the booking reference! As I say, a miracle to check in. 

Overall, it is like most things in life, expensive, over rated and based on nothing. 

Recently I was diverted from Florence to Bologna airport due to bad weather. Once we were in the airport, we had no communication from BA. We waited over 2 hours for our luggage (it was nearing midnight) to find that when it arrived and we eventually got to our hotel and opened our cases, the contents were saturated with water. One can only think our cases had been left out in the rain for a considerable time. 

I could write an easy, no a book, on the poor service but you know what, I have better things to do with my life.

Sadly this was not our experience. We were in extremely poky seats with very little leg room and had nothing offered in terms of snacks or drinks.

at first BA did make an offer to compensate and i thought all would be well after i accepted it, but to my UTTER DISMAY, BA has not paid me the compensation they offered and have IGNORED all my emails asking for a update. this is simply unacceptable customer service and i can't believe an airlines as big as BA would treat its customers like this.

"Our outbound flight from Gatwick to Tampa was cancelled with approx 7 hours’ notice. We were sent a text and email to inform us and a number to call. The number was constantly engaged and so we could not get through. We went to the Glasgow Airport (our connecting airport) where check in staff had to call for us to arrange an alternative. BA had allocated us alternative flights transferring to Heathrow, flying to Washington with a wait to get a connection to Tampa. The Glasgow staff helped us change to a flight from Gatwick to Orlando. We then had to take a taxi, costing an extra $200 to our destination on the gulf coast. 

Our hotel was wonderful. No issues at all with the Hyatt Regency, Clearwater. 

Our inbound flight from Tampa was delayed by two hours. This gave us approx one hour to change at Gatwick to connect to Glasgow. The plane sat on the runway for a long time with no air and so it was incredibly hot. No drinks or towels or anything were offered to passengers. Both our meals and the breakfast naps were burned and the flight was the most uncomfortable we’ve had. BA really does not compare to Virgin for customer service and passenger comfort.

However, when we landed, we had been contacted whilst flying via BA to say our connection was cancelled. This should have been at 11:10hours. They had re booked us on a 17:10hours flight from Heathrow. 

We asked at the resolution desk, who said the flight wasn’t cancelled, BA had cancelled our booking on it as we would not have made the flight. We were given travel vouchers for the National Express bus to go to Heathrow, and told to ask there to get on an earlier flight. The bus journey took an hour. At Heathrow, there were many staff members in terminal 5, but we spoke to 3 before someone would help us, being told misinformation by the first two, who were dismissive of our situation. One told us no staff there could change our flights and we’d have to call BA. We tried this to be told we had to call a different number, which rang out.

We then had to pay for a taxi for a 2 hour transfer to our hotel. 

On the way home, our flight was delayed 24 hours before and then further delayed at the airport. Whilst in flight, BA cancelled us off our connection and moved us to a flight 7 hours later from Heathrow. We had to get a bus from Gatwick to Heathrow then wait to return to Glasgow. We were told by resolutions at Gatwick that Heathrow staff would help change us to an earlier connection, but it took us speaking to 3 staff members before anyone did, with one member of staff saying we had to phone BA as they did not deal with tickets there! Customer Services on the phone were equally as unhelpful, telling us to phone BA Holidays and providing a number which rang out. 

In-flight, the service and comfort is ok, however, not as good as Virgin. The space in economy is very limited and the plane on our return journey was quite old with some seats not sitting upright properly.

It was delayed for about an hour due to equipment (plane) not returning from a previous flight in time.
That wasn't so bad, but then on our return BA 2037 on Sep 5, they had the same excuse and were over 3 hours late.  We paid an exorbitant amount for Business Class and it was a trashy experience.
Besides the 3+ hour delay, the plane had a technical issue where when the engines were turned off (pre and post flight) the lights went out and the a/c was non-existent and we were sweltering for quite a while.
Then the plane takes off and my plug does not work. The stewardess said she would re-set it and after I reminded her a second time she asked someone to re-set it.  They claim they did it multiple times and it didn't work, so I was not able to use my own plug (I like to use my laptop and phone for work, games, etc).  
Then I asked about why I couldn't connect to Wi-Fi in flight...'oh that doesn't work'.

"British Airways Flight Review: A Nightmare of Cancellations, Delays, and Neglect
Flight Details
- Route: Edinburgh to London Heathrow
- Original Departure 5 Sept 
- Status: Cancelled after multiple delays, rebooked for next day
The Ordeal
What was supposed to be a routine 1 hour flight turned into a 15+ hour nightmare of cancellations, delays, and utter neglect by British Airways staff. Here's a breakdown of the horrific experience:

1. Initial Delays: Our flight was repeatedly delayed throughout the evening.

2. Lack of Communication: Ground staff provided minimal information about the delays.

3. Staff Abandonment: Eventually, BA ground staff completely abandoned passengers without explanation.

4. No Basic Care: Not even a bottle of water was offered during the entire ordeal.

5. Cancellation: After hours of waiting, the flight was finally cancelled around 4 AM.

6. Forced to Fend for Ourselves: With no assistance from BA, we had to collect our bags and rebook ourselves on a new flight at 8:10 AM.

7. More Delays: The rebooked flight has been delayed twice, with the latest departure time now set for 9:25 AM.

8. No Compensation: Despite being at the airport for over 15 hours, BA has not offered any meal vouchers or basic amenities.

9. Lack of Empathy: Throughout this entire ordeal, not a single BA representative has shown any empathy or concern for passengers' well-being.

Conclusion
This experience has been nothing short of inhumane. British Airways has demonstrated a shocking lack of empathy, aptitude, and duty of care towards its passengers. The level of neglect shown is not just disappointing – it borders on criminal.

I strongly advise anyone considering flying with British Airways to reconsider their options. This airline has proven that it cannot be trusted to provide even the most basic level of service or care for its customers in challenging situations.

British Airways should be ashamed of how they've treated their passengers. This level of service is unacceptable for any business, let alone a major international airline.",1.0,Edinburgh,London,Domestic,September 2024,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

"I we flying back from Boston to London with my family after a conference. We spent 3 hours in the tarmac with no aircon and little water - due to technical problems. They did pump air into buisness class, but didn't reach us at the back - so 30+ degrees heat. The cabin staff were reluctant to distribute any water out of concern there would not be enough for the flight.

The writing was on the wall when on boarding and the overhead bins being full - 'you can't put them here find somewhere else' from a cabin Staff. Finally, the plane was canceled. We were asked to contact BA via phone - when I did this they said I needed to cancel our tickets and pay the difference for the new ones. Anywhere between 1200GBP, and 2400GBP. Although I repeated said this is BAs responsible- the call handler seemed powerless to do anything else. 3 hours later we got an email to confirm we would fly to Chicago, wait 4 hours and then fly on to London - problem was they put me on a different flight from my family.

The 1 star in this review is for the ground staff who helped me to join my family in their flight. She did this herself, and had little to do with BA's terrible and dysfunctional service protocols.

The 2nd and last time on BA was a resent flight to Seoul via Paris. The problems started at arrival at Heathrow - when loading bags the staff said- 'just check at the gate that these are loaded through to Seoul' - when asking at the gate I was greater with a passive aggressive 'we have no idea and cannot check' - I was advised to check at the gate in Paris. After duly doing so I was advised my bad indeed was checked to Seoul.

After a nervous wait at the carrasell in Seoul - no bag. It took over a week to reach me - no compensation from BA.

My experience of BA is comparatively dreadful. You have been warned.",1.0,Boston,London,International,May 2024,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
Really disappointed with British Airways. British Airways officials at Mumbai airport offered swiipr compensation card with 520 gbp for delayed flights confirming the validity of the card for 6 months.The 6 mnts validity was also mentioned in the card carrier given. However the card stopped working after 3 months and the funds 250 gbp were still there in the card. I contacted the costumer care through calls mails and even raised case references but no executive helped to to reactivate my card. The BA officials at the Mumbai airport where I was issued with the card also did not help me. No one in BA is even aware of these compensation card being issued at specific airports. I regret delaying my flight for a day for this compensation card.

The connecting time was a bit tight then they gave me boarding passes that weren't scanned at the security causing more delay and someone with a patronising attitude turned up way late while we were waiting a while in a huge queue.

"While traveling in Europe with my family, British Airways canceled our return itinerary a week prior to travel dates stating we were 'no shows' on our flights to Spain and France.

"We have flown a couple of times with British Airways and although flight staff have been good the actual service from the company has been awful. We bought business class seats so we could be comfortable flying around Europe on our holiday and to be able to check in and sit in comfort in lounges etc. first flight from London city doesn’t have a lounge (ok not a big issue) had priority check in and then was told flight is full and do we want to check our carry on luggage that we paid for in business class. Then sat on runway for half hour due to some global Microsoft issue then another due to technical fault and then couldn’t leave as they didn’t know who was the passenger list. Return flight from Amsterdam was ok but no priority line so waited in line. Now have been sitting in Lisbon Airport for  4 hours because we can’t check our luggage in even though we checked in online and have business class seats. We were even told after we eventually got to see staff members that we could come back at 3:30 only to get them to be told no we will have to wait another hour and to go and buy a coffee.Trust me if you are looking for customer service and benefits for flying business class DON’T book with British Airways.

I do travel with British Airways every now and again. Manchester control access to the aircraft well by utilising the group numbers BA use and sticking to it. Stops the gate “lurkers” that make Heathrow departures a bad experience because the gate areas are too small and the staff fail to control it. Once on board a full flight like most are as they feed into the main BA services at LHR. Crew on board ensured luggage was distributed well. Efficient but friendly. Near enough on time (0800 departure) and arrived Heathrow likewise as schedule allows for stacking. I am always amazed they distribute to all snacks and water in such a short space of time.

"We have travelled to the UK annually for business and pleasure for years, although we had decided to switch to Air Canada from British Airlines (BA) when service on the latter declined dramatically. However, because of Heathrow's declining quality, BA gave us the Gatwick alternative, so we decided to travel with BA.  in premium economy seats as before.  Very disappointing result. After being summoned to the check-in counter, we were told we had been reassigned to different seats due to the need to put a mother and baby together. Reasonable enough. However, we found when we got on the plane that we were up against the rear bulkhead, which meant little room to recline -  a problem since the folks in the seats ahead chose to fully recline their seats -  perfectly reasonable for them as this was a long flight. Then the hardware on which their seats were mounted left us little legroom. Finally, being in the last row of our compartment, they had run out of food except for a dry, unpalatable, Mediterranean curry we could not eat.

"This year I had decided to use BA to visit my family in Italy, rather than the usual Easyjet, I am a nervous flyer ( not the crazy kind, more the silent crying and praying type) and felt reassured that BA staff and planes are the best in terms of safety. To begin with, the outbound flight to Italy was cancelled a couple of weeks before, and I had to take an extra day off at work to fly a day earlier.  Then, just before my departure day, I was informed that my inbound flight was going to be managed by a Danish company used by BA in busy periods. This escalated my anxiety. I searched this company online, finding out that their planes are quite old. I tried to change the flight, but there was no space on any other BA flights. Ok, I decided to be rationale and sensible, and finally on the 1st of September I went to take my flight back to London. First, the flight was due to depart at 21.50 but we started boarding at 23, which is not ideal especially with young kids and in a terrible airport as the Catania one ( dirty toilets, no toilet paper, not enough chairs to sit,etc.) No explanations provided while waiting at the terminal. Once finally on the frigging Danish plane, the hostess greets us explaining that the delay was due to technical issues on the engine and the computer, which resulted in the wrong data on fuel shown on the screen during the flight from Gatwick to Catania, but NOT to WORRY, all was fine now!🥳 I went in full panic mode, my kids, who saw me, cried and begged to leave the plane. We were reassured by a kind Irish steward, and my young boy could talk with the captain, which made him relax a bit. I took a sleeping pill and tried to numb myself as much as I could and we made it to London at 1.30 am. Nobody checked on us during all flight to see if we were doing ok. And a hostess admitted they should not have disclosed so many details of the reasons of the delay, as some other passenger got stressed out. I think this was the worst experience I have ever had on a flight in terms of fear and despair I felt (only crashing would have been worse😅). In a way it was helpful in making me finally decide to stop flying after 30 years of putting myself through this stress. But, wow, my expectations of BA were so disappointed.

The return flight departed punctually and we arrived early. Comfortable in economy. Meals were better than previous experiences. I ordered a low fat meal and this was good. Healthy! As it was a flight of just under 7 hours, we got one main meal and then a snack before landing. Complimentary snacks and beverages were also provided in between meals. I just think in comparison to Emirates or Singapore Airlines for example, BA has a long way to go. Entertainment onboard wasn't that good. I struggled to find anything I wanted to watch despite the selection. Staff as per usual were unfriendly and cold apart from the odd one or two. Planes were generally clean.

"TLDR: they cancel flights at last minute, don’t give realistic alternative options, their website functionality is useless so you so have to call an incredibly unhelpful customer service provision that you wait hours to talk to and then hangs up on you. You can’t even complain. 

Detail:
Where to even start: they cancelled our flight at 1800 the night before it was due to take off at 1100 the next morning. Offered us a flight 3 days later, that is not realistic. You cannot change to another departures airport on their website so you have to call. The call centre took an hour to pick up, and then we may as well have been talking to a bot as they were so unhelpful. In fact a bot would have been more helpful as it would have not lied to us and then hung up on us in frustration. Anyone would think we were asking to change our flight at the last minute out of our choice! We then called back after a long wait again we were told we had agreed to our flight change on the previous call (we had not) and had to take the flight they’d booked for a later date. By this time it was 2230. We insisted they listen to the previous call to see that we did not agree to the change. The previous call handler had left a note saying we had an agreed whe we hadn’t. The second call handler said they would listen to the first call and call us back in a couple of hours. They called back at 0040. We were obviously asleep and this was very annoying. They finally admitted their mistake
When we called back the next morning. The final night of our holiday ruined, a lot of extra hassle and an incredibly frustrating and angering experience, we have flights booked with ba in the autumn. The are fully flexible and we will be cancelling them as we’ve had enough. They’d already cancelled our outbound flight too and we’ve had enough of the cancellations. Throw in the incredibly frustrating approach to customer services and AWFUL website and you get a seagull airline that doesn’t value its register customers and doesn’t actually fulfil its purpose of flying people from a to b. Cherry on top is that you can’t even complain as the website is so bad the complaints form wouldn’t give me any option to submit what I’d written!

"**Avoid British Airways at all costs!**

We had an incredibly disappointing experience with British Airways on flight BA2202, traveling back home after what had been an amazing holiday. Our journey from Gatwick to Cancún was smooth, and we were informed that we had a free baggage allowance of 23kg per passenger. However, the return flight was a nightmare.

Pedro Alvarez, the duty manager, was shockingly aggressive and rude, particularly towards my teenage daughter and me. His behavior was not just unprofessional, but blatantly racist, as we were singled out from the queue without any valid reason.

To make matters worse, the check-in agent, Irma Lopez, charged us £140 for two hold bags, despite our baggage allowance. What made this even more infuriating was that we were the only passengers charged for our luggage, while others with over five bags were not charged anything. It was clear that the only two Black passengers were being treated by a “different code.” I have serious doubts that this charge was in line with BA’s policies—it felt more like the money went straight into their own pockets.

The flight from Cancún to Gatwick was a nightmare, and it’s a shame that people like Pedro Alvarez and Irma Lopez represent British Airways in their uniform. British Airways should be ashamed of how they treat their passengers. We will never fly with them again and strongly advise others to avoid this airline.",1.0,Cancun,London,International,August 2024,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
"Took family to Berlin for a 4 day city break. Outgoing flight from LHR delayed by 1 hour due to staffing issues. Return flight delayed by over 2 hours due to a security breach at Berlin Airport. On the return journey passengers were checked in and left standing in the hot boarding gangway between the departure lounge and the plane door for 25 minutes. Total lack of information from airport staff and passengers only returned back up the gangway to the departure lounge after one kind lady passenger ushered everyone to do so. No explanation offered for over 90 minutes during which passengers became more and more upset. After about 90 minutes an announcement was made saying that the problem was due to an IT glitch. When we finally boarded the plane the pilot told us that the delay was due to a security breach due to incoming passengers mixing with outgoing passengers. 
 
The real issue was not so much that the flight was delayed but that no meaningful information or updates were given to waiting passengers. To leave passengers standing in a hot gangway for 25 minutes is quite unacceptable.

"Firstly, I would like to comment on the flight service from the flight attendants. We were first rudely welcomed by the inflight manager named, Alessio Gaggioli, who made a patrionising comment on my father’s backpack saying that “you should really watch where you are swinging your bag”. As customers who pay decent amount of money for well respected services, I don’t expect the manager to be ordering attendees to watch where they are going. May I mention that the bag my father was holding did not nearly touch the man nor did he swing it, and it was not nearly a size too big to come in contact with anyone. This behaviour especially having just stepped in the plane he is meant to be welcoming guests, not verbally assaulting them. Secondly, the airplane had no air conditioning for 20 minutes and we had asked the senior flight attendant whether the aircon would be on soon, as Hong Kong has an extremely humid climate. Her response was truly shocking as we had already had an unappealing experience before the flight. She spoke in a sarcastic manner implying to stop questioning and be patient. What an absolutely repulsive response. This type of disgraceful behaviour should not be allowed on a flight especially when the majority were dying from suffocation and they were just using their positions trying to abuse their powers. We pay a lot of money not to be tormented with bad services from senior members of cabin crew.

Due to no longer being able to fly for my original flight, I called and spoke to someone who gave me a new reference number where I could book at a later date/destination or change the name. I then had a close family member pass away suddenly to to which I then offered my mother my ticket to fly out for the funeral, as I was told I could change the name. 
When then calling and trying to do this, I then got told that I was unable to do this unless we proved this by sending the death certificate as stated in the ‘policy’. After questioning this and not wanting to get false information, I made this representative double check and confirm this to which she did. 
After then troubling my aunt and uncle, who are grieving over the sudden loss of their son (my cousin) for this documentation, we then sent it to the to email provided and called to get this now changed into my mothers name. To which we then found out was yet ANOTHER lie and that this cannot be done as you can only change the name if the ticket holder has passed away (which makes no sense as they would be dead so how can they challenge a name change.) After expressing my feelings of mistrust, that I would be taking it further as I no longer wanting to have anything to do with this company, I was told that I wasn’t allowed any refund and was only allowed to book it at a later date. I then challenged the representative to speak to a manger to which I was told, they had none working, they had gone home and that no one had any direct email.
After then putting in a formal complaint 5 MONTHS AGO WITH STILL NO RESPONSE. I called back to use the money to book a new flight to say I couldn't as it was a less amount (even after saying fine keep the remaining money) and I was only allowed to book the same amount or more (scam to get more money out of you).

"Extremely annoyed and dissatisfied with a truly terrible service from British Airways.

Holiday of a lifetime so we decided to splash out on business class.  What a waste of money that was and by the lack of any response of comms from BA, they could not care less!

Started when checking in.  We stood about 6th out of maybe 20 people in the queue in the BA Europe line for ‘priority’ check in and waited for over an hour until just about all the standard (over 100 people) queue had checked in.  Wasn’t the biggest issue I know but a little bit annoying when you’ve paid a premium to check in fast.

The onboard business class experience was shocking and nothing like I was expecting…. 
﻿
﻿Faulty tv and headphones.  Reset 3 times by the cabin crew.  Remote control had a mind of its own changing channel, volume, forward, rewind and then whole system just packed in completely. Crew gave me some masking tape to tape the headphones plug to the socket as volume went from nothing to about 100db crackling. 14 hour flight and no entertainment system.  I wouldn’t expect this in any seat on the plane never mind one that cost a premium.

WiFi never worked for the whole journey.  USB chargers didn’t work whole journey.

The worst of all was the chair.  None of the buttons worked so wouldn’t adjust and wouldn’t go flat (the whole reason for booking this cabin), 3 cabin crew tried to move it /  adjust it but couldn’t which went on until about 2am (5 hours into the flight) before they shifted me to a different part of the plane to a seat that worked.  I got some rest but I was then not travelling with my (nervous flyer) partner which became a nightmare as I had to come back and forth during the night to check on her.

I wish we had booked standard.  At least we would have sat together and not had the whole night disrupted.  It is the most tiring and stressful flight I’ve ever been on despite sitting in the business class cabin.

Cabin crew were so embarrassed about the seat after the tv issues.  They really shouldn’t be put into that position. 

Went back to original seat for landing after 2 of the cabin crew ‘kicked’ the chair back into position.  

Nothing in the cabin worked….i really hope other parts of the plane are maintained better!

Premium experience in business class….yeah right.  We couldn’t wait to get off the plane.

Cherry on the cake was to until every bad had gone from the carousel then find out that one of our bags had not made the journey.  Got told the other bag may(!) come tomorrow.    How one of our ‘priority’ bags can have made it and the other didn’t is beyond me. 

The bag did turn up 1 and half days later so we had to buy a few essential things to get by but the 48 hours of our holiday was pretty much a disaster. I don’t know if they will be reimbursed or not. The complaint / refund form to fill in with BA is a nightmare which looks designed to put people of filling it in. We spent a lot of hours doing it (on holiday).

We are 6 days into our holiday waiting for BA to contact us.  We haven’t heard from BA at all other than an automated message.  They clearly couldn’t care less.

"It's 777 and it has a door..... not that it really needs one because the layout offers some privacy already. The door is very short thus not much privacy either. The food is on a smaller portion and no snacks were offered the entire flight. Even though this configuration is not that old but my side compartment, the top part is broken already so I would have to slam it hard to close it. 
We were seated right behind their 1st class, thus in a smaller section of business class. I was given a mattress pad (mini size because it only covered half of the seat) and a blanket. The seat when in laying position created a very uncomfortable gap between the seat cushion and the back of the seat so I had to use the mattress pad to fill in the gap.

"This was one of the most abysmal flight experiences I’ve had in a while. I paid to have an exit, aisle seat and found out a week before my flight that regardless of being charged for the seats, I’d been removed from them. I called to ask what happened and try to ensure I was at least able to get a window or an aisle seat. The agent apologized and moved me back to my original, purchased seat. But when I went to check in, I realized I’d been moved again and this time I was sitting in a middle seat (something I wouldn’t have chosen and had it been the only seat left I’d have chosen a different flight). They said the flight was full and I learned that the flight the night before had been cancelled and someone from that flight was given my seat. So, I sat in a middle seat for 6 hours…and my movie screen just happened to be the only one in the row that didn’t work. And to top it off, dinner was a rice cake, some sort of sour pudding, and mashed potatoes. When the flight attendant asked if I planned to sleep, as I was smashed between two people without an arm rest, I just stared at him like he was nuts. I did notice that the first 20 rows were first class. But if you don’t pay for first class, you are basically sitting on top of the person next to you, eating rice cakes, and staring at a broken screen the entire time.",1.0,Washington DC,London,International,August 2024,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0

"As a frequent traveller maybe 10 times around the world nearley with all various airlines I never had so many problems that I witnessed with my flights with BA.

So whatever you experience on BA flights like you are abused by third parties ext just keep quiet and do not attempt to look for a solution otherwise you may end up offloaded from the BA flight in the middle of the night with your 10-year-old daughter including without your luggages. I faced the most dramatic experience of my life on this particular flight because the captain of this flight had no mercy at all and used his power to suffer the victims rather than fining the individuals who caused the problem. This incident without mercy and the wrong judgment of the Captain in charge resulted in the cost of £1700. to me until I reached my destination the next day without the pieces of luggage that BA managed to send to us after 3 days of our arrival to our destination. The good side of it was BA answered my complaint saying how sorry they were and they honored me with £100. (hundred) pounds of E-Ticket voucher to fly with BA again have the same experience which was incredibly very touchy and sensitive handling of the case.

"The word that most accurately describes British Airways is imbecilic. Literally everything that could possibly go wrong- and some things that I didn't think were possible to mess up- did. My first flight ended up delayed for over three and a half hours, first because the flight crew missed their ride from the hotel to the airport, then because when they were finally on their way they broke down on the side of the road and waited for someone on the airport to come get them because apparently these people who supposedly can fly planes were incapable of calling an Uber. Once on the plane (2 hours late) we taxied out only to have to sit on the tarmac for an hour and actually return to standby because our flight plan was expired, the baggage was mislabelled, and trying to fix all this took so long we had to refuel. We landed almost four hours after we were supposed to causing myself and many hours to miss our connecting flights. To add insult to injury, I am writing this waiting for my new connecting flight which has just been delayed for two hours because - shockingly - the crew is late.

"I am yet to go on this flight however I am having issues with BA that I feel anyone thinking of booking a flight with them should be aware of. 
I booked this flight in April 2024 for Feb 2025, my family and I like to be organised so we book early and pay for seats to ensure we are sat together. 
In May was notified that our seats had changed. This was due to an aircraft change which I totally understand however they had re-allocated seat that were totally different so I called them and after 3 separate calls and many bizarre conversations (during one of the calls I was told that although pretty much all seats were available we couldn’t have any aisle seat as they were: I quote “all reserved for handicapped people” !!) Finally our seats were re-booked and I could see confirmation of this on the app. 
Having been reassured that it was now all sorted, today I happened to check my app (now 2 months later) to find no seats allocated to my booking! This time I didn’t even receive an email to inform me of this! I made another call to them to find out it was due to a switch of aircraft on just the return flight (but they had still removed the seats from both flights) and to be told that I could go online to rebook myself and pay the extra that was required (all seats were more expensive than what I had paid originally). During the phone call I was told that it is standard procedure that your seats are removed should there be a change of aircraft or seat configuration (and seemingly also pricing structure!)They will offer you a refund if this occurs and you can re-book at the now higher price than what you already paid! Outrageous when it isn’t my fault! 
If this is standard practice then it seems to be a way to get you to pay even more for seats even when you have already paid! Shame on you British Airways!
The customer service person I spoke to was less than sympathetic; he said BA would foot the bill for the seat change as a gesture of goodwill but normally we would have to take a refund and pay for the seating choices again! He said that BA do not have to re-allocate seats even though we had already paid!
I read BA’s terms and conditions and (see attached image) it clearly says that they will attempt to find you a suitable alternative and if you are unhappy with this then you may apply for a refund for your seats. Looking at the seat map for available seats……all seats were available so I fail to see how BA could not find suitable seats for my family!

"My aunt had a 2 day layover in the UK to visit me on her way back to the US from Spain. She arrived late on a Thurs evening, and flew out again early Sun morning. BA lost her bag and were meant to deliver it to her at my house... they phoned the Fri evening and said they would bring it on the Saturday afternoon. 

6pm Saturday, no bag. She phoned, and was told if the bag did not arrive by 8pm (which it didn't) to go on their website to update the delivery address to her home address in the US (which she did). Lo and behold, guess what gets delivered to my house in the UK on Wednesday... her bag. Sadly, it was delivered to our neighbour as we weren't in, so were unable to refuse it. 

I tried phoning BA, but as my name was not on their system, they would not speak to me about it- fair enough. They gave me their US number for my aunt to ring so she could arrange for collection and add my name to the file in case I needed to call - which she was told had been done and that the bag would be collected on Friday.

"On Saturday the 17th, i was flying from Brussels to London (BA397) and from London to Johannesburg (BA57). 
Around 13:00, I realise that my flight from Brussels to London will have a delay for about 30’ which would result in losing my second flight. 

I immediately contact British airways (online) where the agent told me that i will am probably going to miss my connection and that i should call someone and ask what my options are. 

I had a call with an agent  on this phone ( +44 20 7949 3086), which she tried to book me on a different flight with other airlines in order to make sure i arrive on time to my final destination (for an important business meeting). After having a conversation with the agent for nearly 2 hours, she CONFIRMED that she had put me on a flight from Brussels to Frankfurt (SN617) and from Frankfurt to Johannesburg (LH572). The flight from Brussels was earlier than my previous one, hence i ordered a taxi immediately and WHILE i was waiting for its arrival outside my house, i receive a mail saying that I should call British Airways (why dont you call me - what if i haven’t seen the mail??).
I call back while i am riding the taxi to the airport, and during this call they could not find the flight that the previous agent has put me on, and that i had to take the flight to London anyway, where the agents would help me upon my arrival with my connection flight.

"Why must the customer negotiate a basic right under EU Regulation 261/2004? The customer has the right to select a later date of their preference for reaching their destination when a flight is canceled by British Airways. Respectfully, British Airways' internal policies—limiting rebooking within 14 days of the cancellation—are not my concern. Since my flight has been canceled, it is incumbent upon British Airways, as the carrier, to meet its legal obligation to transport me to my destination on a date of my choosing, in accordance with my rights as a passenger. Furthermore, rebooking should can only in the same ticket class originally purchased, and it is unacceptable for British Airways to automatically rebook a flight to an alternative destination without the passenger's consent, potentially leading to a suboptimal travel arrangement. It is deeply disappointing to see British Airways disregard customers' legal rights and implement practices that may mislead customers into forfeiting their entitlements, all in pursuit of maximizing profit.",1.0,Zurich,London,Europe,August 2024,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

"This is my complaint I put forward to BA after the worse flight of my life! 

Dear British Airways Customer Service Team,
I am writing to express my extreme disappointment and disgust with the lack of customer service and discrimination I received on my recent flight from Bridgetown (Barbados) to London Heathrow Airport on 18th August 2024 .

During the flight, I experienced a situation where a fellow passenger pushed back his seat while hot drinks were being served, almost causing scalding hot coffee to spill on myself and a small child sitting next to me 42D. When I politely asked the passenger to put his seat back up as I was trying to drink the coffee without spilling it, he verbally abused me without any provocation. To my dismay, the flight attendant who intervened only listened to one side of the story 'can you please put your seat up' and immediately sided with the male passenger, showing favoritism and bias towards me. 

Furthermore, I was humiliated and singled out by the flight attendants for simply trying to steady myself while getting up to go to the restroom, causing unnecessary embarrassment in front of other passengers. The attitude of the staff, especially the dark-haired female hostess, was extremely rude and unprofessional. Despite being visibly upset and requesting to be moved to a different seat to avoid further confrontation with the male passenger, I was informed by Amy (blonde hair) that no seats, including first class seats, were available without any empathy or alternative solutions offered. Even though I was willing to pay for that service.

Throughout the flight, i felt dismissed, and discriminated against by the British Airways staff. The lack of care for my safety and well-being, as well as the well-being of the child next to me, was appalling. I cried for the remainder of the flight and was too scared to even move from my seat to use the toilet for fear of further mistreatment.When it comes to flying anxiety, premenopause can heighten feelings of fear and panic. Additionally, physical symptoms such as hot flashes and palpitations can also contribute to anxiety while flying. I expressed this with Amy and informed her that I was overheating with the lack of space and although staff have no control over other passengers behaviours they do have control over their own. And zero empathy was shown. 

I am writing to express my disappointment in the behavior of some staff members during my flight. I observed that some staff members removed their name badges and turned lanyards around, when I mentioned that I intended to make a complaint about their treatment towards me. Additionally, other passengers were visibly disapproving of the staff's behaviors. It was clear that I was trying to protect a young child from being scolded, and the staff could have simply asked for clarification instead of making assumptions based on previous interactions with other passengers.
Furthermore, when I was trying to explain what had happened, one older male lead host rudely asked me to lower my voice, I often have hearing problems and my ears were also popping at the time, and this was the reason, but even that being said I was speaking no louder than him. I was not raising my voice, but simply recounting the situation. This level of discrimination is unacceptable and truly disheartening.
I want to highlight the good service provided by Samuel on the flight, who unlike the rest treated me with respect and kindness in contrast to the dismissive and rude behavior of the other staff members. However, the overall experience has left me deeply traumatized and I have no intention of ever flying with British Airways again.

I urge British Airways to investigate this matter thoroughly and address the lack of customer service and professionalism displayed by the flight attendants on this flight. I expect a prompt response and resolution to this issue.",1.0,Bridgetown,London,International,August 2024,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
"Worst experience ever!!!!
For 9 years now, we always use British Airways for our flight to Greece. Everything goes smooth each time, staff and crew professional, on time, nothing to complain about.
 But on 6th of August, at around 18:45 at Heathrow Airport we had the worst experience while waiting to drop our luggage. BA employee, On her name SANDRA started to yell at people to use the self check counter to drop the luggage. People were confused, many didn't know how to use the service, but she was yelling to ,, keep moving''. She yelled at my 4 year old to don't touch the computer screen that she started to cry.

"Only chose BA for this holiday as the flight times were good. When you have a 4.5 hour or so flight and a 1 hour onward transfer you really don't want your flight to be late, thereby reducing your holiday time at your destination! Every single flight I've taken with BA in the last 3 or 4 years has been late by at least 40 minutes (that's 8 or  flights by the way), some around 4 hours and 1 flight last October was completely cancelled back to Heathrow, they tried to make us go to Gatwick which we refused. 

I will say that the cabin crew customer service has improved in the last couple of years which is why I rated 3 instead of the 2 stars I was going to give. I'll explain a bit more about my rating. On this most recent flight I had used air miles to book specific seats. The last row of the aircraft basically so as to not risk having someone continuously kick the back of our seats as has happened on several occasions with toddlers sitting on their parents' laps and kicking the seat. Sitting on the back row takes that risk out completely. On our outward flight, we just boarded and sat in the back row. Imagine our surprise (and embarrassment) when 15 minutes later a couple asked us if we were in the correct seats and I said of course. Then they showed their boarding pass and we were very confused thinking we'd been double booked, only to then realise that 30a and 30b were actually 7 rows ahead, BA had changed the aircraft type and basically we had to apologise and move to the correct row. I never got my airmiles back from BA which were used to specifically book the back row as BA's policy seems to be to do whatever they want and not refund your airmiles!

Somehow we were the absolute last row to be served with the drinks service which was extremely annoying as we'd bought water on board with us and had actually finished it so were desperate for a drink by the time they got to our row, which made no sense as the same thing happened on the way home when we were actually at the back of the aircraft (as per our actual seats we'd booked) and still ended up being the very last row to be served, you can't make this stuff up?! Also on previous flights they would give you a snack and small bottle of water, now they walk around giving you a VERY SALTY snack and then make you wait 2 hours before you can buy a bottle of water or other drinks! Infuriating! 

In the last 2 years, I've flown Premium Economy long haul and Business Class long haul. I had vowed not to go Business Class with BA again after the last time 6 or 7 years ago but my employer was paying and I have to admit it was (marginally) better than my previous experience and Premium Economy was also decent enough (again these flights were also each delayed).

On a return flight from Germany 2 years ago on a Friday evening, the flight was nearly 4 hours departing which meant I didn't get home till 4am Saturday morning which basically through out my weekend. I did apply for my compensation for European flights being delayed more than 3 hours and did get this with no quibble (I think it's around £350/Eur400) which I also claimed for hubby and myself due to a cancelled flight in October 2023 which was cancelled due to 'aircraft serviceability'  whatever that means - at that time we were on holiday and met 4 other couples who were also supposed to be on our flight who had had similar issues 2 or 3 times in the preceding 3 or 4 months!

As a bronze member, I suppose at least I can check in quicker using the business/first class check in desks. Still when you board at the gate amongst the first then have to wait till the bus is full you still don't get on the flight before the rest of the passengers, so it makes a mockery of the 'first to board' feature!

As a final note, it's quite disgusting for me as a passenger to board a flight that hasn't been cleaned in between flights, I hate seeing the remains of other people's food on seats, on the food trays. Why are BA so cheap that they don't get their aircraft cleaned anymore? It's bad enough that they're always late, I suppose cleaning the aircraft would make them even later!",3.0,London,Rhodes,Europe,June 2017,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,3.0
"Used as part of a bigger trip (all booked with BA). 

Flight was late boarding by 40 minutes due to a technical fault with the plane. Once all passengers were on board it was announced that due to a problem with the jet bridge a further delay of about 60 minutes was expected.

The flight left and made its way across the Atlantic but about an hour before landing we started to fly a holding pattern for over two hours due to a thunderstorm over New York. Funnily enough, prior to leaving London the pilot said that the aircraft was originally meant to be going to Hong Kong and had plenty of fuel onboard.

We were then diverted to Philadelphia where we were placed on a taxiway as the airport was full with other diverted aircraft. To complicate the matter was the fact that the storm was now over Philadelphia and the airport was closed.

After about 3 1/2 hours slowly making our way around to a parking gate we were given the bad news from the Captain. The operations team in London had decided that there was nothing they would do to get us to Newark and we were to make our own way. By now it was after 9pm and we were due into Newark at 3pm.

After quickly clearing US immigration and luggage collection we spoke to BA ground staff, whose attitude was ' you're not meant to be here  so there's nothing we will do to help' and refused to help or offer any advice or support. A very kind security was of more help than the useless BA staff ,directed us to the travel interchange where we enquired about getting to New York. We were told that the last train was leaving at 11pm to the city main station but booking was required for both trains. 

As there was a lot of other airlines having diverted to Philadelphia , the hotel rates were sky high so we decided to get a taxi!!!!!

The flight and cabin crew advised us before leaving the aircraft that BA would cover reasonable expenses to get us to our destination. This was backed up by an email. BA are now claiming that meant £20 per person for a meal, £10 per person for breakfast and reasonably priced hotel along with reasonable travel costs.

Due to the time we spent on the aircraft, water and snacks were running out and half the were out of order.

The crew on the aircraft were excellent all through the time onboard and cannot be faulted.

My thoughts are that if we had left on time would we have landed before the storm arrived and was that the reason the aircraft had as much fuel in case we were held up? 

No doubt BA will claim they are not liable for compensation as the delay was due to weather but as noted above , if we had left on schedule would we have avoided the storm?",2.0,London,Newark,International,August 2024,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

When I asked them why they said sorry it was an error on our side please bear with us.

"For what should be such an iconic national brand you would not expect such awful unreliable service and a total lack of respect for their customers.

Apparently you cannot speak to BA customer service on the phone? You also can't get a straight answer to the numerous issues that have occurred and apparently its standard practice and quite acceptable to sell more seats than you have on a plane and leave paying customers without  a seat? Normal businesses have limits, if I go to a concert or similar event the venue will have a capacity and once full the event is sold out.  It seems that BA and other airlines do not follow logic and can sell the same sold seats over and over again. Never mind if the plane is full you can still resell a seat already paid for by another customer? How BA can effectively 'steal' the seat you have paid for is beyond me! What followed after this happened to us on our home was an extremely stressful and anxious experience which BA find perfectly acceptable for their customers to experience in pursuit of maximum income generation. 

Ever since it has been lie after lie from BA, after emails back and forward because you cannot contact them directly to speak too, a promised phone call has never happened.

To make matters worse I wrote to Sean Doyle, CEO over 3 weeks ago and have had no response from anyone.

I would expect this treatment from a budget airline but thought by paying a premium  and flying with an iconic brand like BA we would be in safe hands but alias no.

**Avoid British Airways at all costs!**

We had an incredibly disappointing experience with British Airways on flight BA2202, traveling back home after what had been an amazing holiday. Our journey from Gatwick to Cancún was smooth, and we were informed that we had a free baggage allowance of 23kg per passenger. However, to our surprise this wasn’t the case on our return flight. 

Pedro Alvarez, the duty manager, was shockingly aggressive and rude, particularly towards my teenage daughter.  His behaviour was very unprofessional, and I feel that his mistreatment of us had strong underlying racial tones as we were singled out of the queue for no valid reason at all. 

To make matters worse, the check-in agent, Irma Lopez, charged us an extortionate £140 for two hold bags, despite our baggage allowance. What made this even more infuriating was that we were the only passengers charged for our luggage, while other passengers with over five bags were not charged at all. I am extremely disappointed that our trip had to end on such a low point and I now have some serious doubts that this incident goes against BA’s equal treatment policies for all passengers. 

The flight from Cancún to Gatwick was a nightmare, and it’s a shame that people such as Pedro Alvarez and Irma Lopez represent British Airways. BA should be ashamed of how these employees treated their passengers. We will never fly with them again and strongly advise others to avoid this airline at all cost!",1.0,Cancun,London,International,August 2024,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

"Booking Reference: [THRLOS]
Original Itinerary: Mumbai to Toronto via London
Class of Service: Business Class
Date of Travel: 31st July
What Went Wrong:

Cancelled Connecting Flight & Downgrade Attempt:
My connecting flight from London to Toronto, originally scheduled for 5:05 PM, was canceled. British Airways rebooked me on a flight the next day at 8:30 AM. Upon accepting the new booking, I discovered that my ticket had been downgraded from Business Class to Economy without any prior notice. The airline had issued a single-night hotel voucher and a coach transfer voucher to the hotel.
Misleading Communication:
BA assured me that I would retain my Business Class seat, but this turned out to be false. I only realized the downgrade after clearing immigration, where I was granted a visa based on the next day’s flight. When I tried to check in for the new flight, I discovered the downgrade and approached the ground staff, who rudely refused to help, stating that they only handle baggage issues. No BA senior staff were available to assist, and many other passengers faced similar rebooking issues, with some being rerouted via Paris or other cheaper routes.
Luggage Delays and Lack of Support:
My luggage, which consisted of six heavy bags, arrived after a 5-hour wait. No assistance was provided to manage the luggage. The ground staff attempted to send me out of the airport, claiming that there was a BA customer service counter on the 3rd floor, which I later discovered was just a ticket booking counter. Refusing to exit the airport, I simultaneously tried to reach BA’s customer care via phone chat.
Customer Care Nightmare:
After waiting for 60 minutes, I was connected to a customer care representative who initially refused to help, claiming I had already accepted the Economy Class seat. I argued that I was unaware of the downgrade until I attempted to check in, as it wasn’t mentioned in the e-ticket they sent. Despite repeated attempts to convince me to accept Economy or Premium Economy, I firmly refused. Finally, after a 50-minute chat, they rebooked me in Business Class on 2nd August. When I asked about my visa, which was granted based on a single-day stay, I was told I would have to manage it myself.
Additional Costs and No Reimbursement:
BA provided a hotel voucher for one night only, and for the second night, I was forced to cover all expenses, including stay, meals, and travel, out of my own pocket. After arriving in Toronto, I submitted an online claim on 3rd August, but to this date, I have received no response from BA. Customer care gives inconsistent answers, sometimes saying it will take 14-18 weeks, sometimes 28 working days, and sometimes claiming they don’t know.
Cancellation of Return Flight:
On 8th August, I contacted BA to cancel my return journey on 16th September from Toronto to Mumbai. They said it would take 72 hours to calculate the refund. After 120 hours, on 12th August, I still hadn’t received an update, and customer care asked me to wait another 48-72 hours.
Final Thoughts:
This experience has shown me that British Airways provides a subpar service, where customer care is nearly impossible to reach unless you have ample time and patience. The long waiting times and lack of clarity are unacceptable. Compared to other airlines, BA's service feels low-grade, and it seems like they prioritize cutting costs over taking responsibility for their passengers. In today’s competitive airline industry, I would advise others to choose airlines with a strong focus on customer care rather than being swayed by competitive fares (which I did, and now I deeply regret it).",1.0,Mumbai,Toronto,International,July 2024,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0

"My husband tried to checkin to a BA flight to start his journey to Malindi in Kenya to attend his Fathers funeral. 

He was refused to check in as the lady said she could not see his name. She told him to call the company who had booked my flight, when he asked if she could check the name again , she told him to stand to move away from the queue and call the people he had booked his flight with. He  did and they told him there was no problem. By the time he had queued up again check in was closed. He asked to speak to a Supervisor, he was told no one was available. He asked what to do she told be to buy a new flight to Kenya. He was in such a state of grief, he did what she told me at a cost of £1880. (my work meant I was uncontactable until 3.30pm)

He waited for this new flight again. Only to be refused again by BA and missed this flight to be told he was not in the right place even though it said BA on his ticket. English is not first language but he was not helped to show him by anyone from BA to tell him where he should be. He was at a loss.

He called me at 3.30 and I went back to the airport, to try and assist him. He was in tears of frustration , anger and grief. 
I asked to speak to a supervisor who came immediately, she logged into the flight of the morning and found him immediately. she said she didn't see what the problem was. She escalated the problem and booked my husband onto a flight that night to London and a flight the following morning to Nairobi.
But  BA did not offer Hotel accommodation for the night in London, Taxis to and from the hotel, the flight from Nairobi to Malindi or Mombasa or a return journey home.

Whilst my husband was in Kenya I tried to speak to BA to sort out my husbands return flight but they refused to speak to me as I was not the passenger! This was after a 35 minute wait to get through to them on the phone.

We then had to purchase a return flight home with Kenya Airways at £976 as my husband had not used the outbound of the £1880 flight, this flight was nul and void.

WE logged refund query with BA back in March... no response from them at all. We have chased and all we get to told is to wait as they have lots queries, we are are in a queue.. How long do we have to wait???

How bad is this? Do they have so many complaints they cannot get to our?
The service we have received has been appalling. MY husband was distressed and asked to speak to a supervisor on the day but no one came. but when I arrived I got to speak to a supervisor and received help immediately.??? 
When we have added this up, this trip for a funeral cost in the region of  £3800

"British Airways cancelled our flight and put on a flight 2 days later. 
I will never fly British Airways again. 
My family left London Heathrow on our flight home to DC around 5pm on a Friday. After about an hour the pilot turned around due to a malfunctioning smoke alarm. While they initially said they could replace the alarm (and did), it took so long they eventually decided they missed the window to get back underway.  At this point we were on the plane for 2 hours on the tarmac and then it took another 2 hours to deboard. Obviously the first class passengers were attended to first after having been given food during the wait. We were offered water but nothing to eat. I got up and went to the stewards area and helped myself to some small snack bags for my children, since they were feeling sick after not having eaten for five hours. 
We were handed sheets of paper that we were told were shuttle vouchers, hotel voucher, and vouchers for up to 10 pounds to spend on food. I asked for some direction regarding where to find the shuttles and was waved along and told to go to arrivals. 
There was no shuttle that went to our assigned hotel. So we had to get a taxi. (I asked the hotel when we arrived - no shuttles go there.). Once we arrived, after midnight - the rebooking information came through. While my husband was booked the next day (Saturday at 4pm), the kids and I were on a flight Sunday morning to Brussels, and then to DC. I called customer service and they informed me that everything was booked. The agent also presented this as not problematic at all for us to be delayed several days. Of course everything was booked. British Airways just cancelled a flight for hundreds of people and rather than outfitting a new plane they expected to put everyone into the already full system. I did find out that they were not looking into ANY flight, but had limited our options to economy since that was what our original tickets were. 
The customer service agent said since I didn’t like what they had done, I could call back at 7:30 am to see if anything opened up.  Of course I called at 7:30 and my call was dropped four times. I was later told that the customer service center didn’t open until 8am. (The website said 7:30am as well.) While the customer service representative was sympathetic, there were no openings. I did find out that there were premier seats available on a flight and that we could not have them. Apparently British Airways has no desire to get people home as quickly as possible. So we are stranded in London, helpless to do anything because British Airways didn’t properly service their planes, would not set up a new plane the next day for the hundreds of people they displaced, and will not book people into ANY available seat to fix their mistake.

"Systems and policies are there to run a service smoothly however people are there to apply it sensibly and friendly. I did not notice any of these with British Airways ground staff in Heathrow airport at terminal 5 at gate 13A at 10.35 am flight to Manchester on 09th August 2024. 
I travelled with my family (Four of us) from Australia after a holiday. We flew with Qantas Airways and this was the connection flight to Manchester. We had one hand luggage for all 4 of us with our laptops and nice fragile souvenirs that we bought in Australia and New Zealand. As this was a busy flight, ground staff has been advised to check in all including hand luggage in customers in zone 4 - 9. Despite my explanation that we carry one hand luggage for four of us with fragile items, ground staff did not allow me to take it into the cabin. They were not ready to even listen to me. There was no friendliness or willingness to listen. I had to leave my hand luggage with them. Our souvenirs were all intact when I checked in Heathrow airport. They were broken when I received the luggage in Manchester. Most sad thing of this is that there were lot of overhead compartment areas free in the flight when we got on to it and they could have allowed us to carry our one hand luggage for four passengers. 
This experience has ruined our whole holiday experience. I am not going to complain as I already know their answer is that it is my responsibility to pack them safely. It was safely packed for a hand luggage which was proved as they were safe when I checked in Heathrow Airport to take laptops out for security check. 
I am happy to be contacted by a senior member in British Airways if they genuinely want to improve the experience of the customers. Staff can make customer experience much better without any effort by applying common sense and bit of friendliness.

"I want to thank British airways for the worst flight experience I have had in awhile.  Not only was my inbound late due to not having a gate.  Flight 193 on 7/27 was the worst, we were in the lounge and left to go to the gate on the way to gate got a text message from flight view app that the plane was delayed for 90 minutes, we sat at gate until 2 without any announcement on the delay and then got another announcement that the flight was delayed until 515 so we went back to lounge, we asked the lady at lounge if we should go back and she couldn't get ahold of anyone to confirm the flight was ready.  We decided to go as the message on the board said go to gate.  The flight said go to gate at 515 and no boarding.  Twenty minutes later we got the announcement that flight was cancelled pick up your bags at baggage claim and there are no agents to rebook your flights, use the app.  Thankfully I am tech savy but many of the people on the flight were people that were retired and had no idea what to do.  We waited over an hour for bags and found someone to help us with hotel and transportation vouchers.  The funny thing about flight 193 is I had been checking it all week since we had tight connection and it averages an hour to hour and 30 minutes late daily.  There would have been no way to make connection.  I asked lady at the lounge about the on time record of this flight and she said they have had trouble with the airbus 380 for months.  Yet this route is sold at 115 daily.  When you call and complain you end up at least 30 minutes on hold and you don't get answers.  In addition to this flight problems our inbound to Norway our bag was delayed for 5 days causing us to spend about $400 on essentials for our trip.  This is a substandard airlines, if you have other options, choose wisely.  Next year I will pay more for a better experience.

"1. I paid an additional £1200 compared to other providers offering similar services.

My return flight was particularly disappointing; I had a sore throat and a fever, and when I requested a blanket, the staff firmly denied my request, stating that blankets are not provided on short flights, despite my explanation that the flight would last at least four hours and I was feeling unwell. I regret choosing British Airways and spending an extra £1200 unnecessarily, as I could have opted for Pegasus or Wings instead.

"One of the worst flights I have ever been on there and back. The flight to JFK was horrific there we got in the plane and there was a three hour delay, we had to wait in our seats for 3 hours before we even took off. They didn’t even have the decency to give out or even offer any sort of food to keep us going they just left us to rot for 3 hours and of course they took off 10 minutes before any of us were allowed to get any sort of compensation. 
The flight back was just as worse again another delay this time our flight cancelled and when we did eventually get on. The food we did get served tasted and had the appearance of canned dog food. The worst thing I have ever ate and me and my family had to suffer the repercussions for days after as this lazy airline couldn’t be bothered to spend a minuscule amount of it’s billions on food that is actually suitable for human consumption.

"BA is possibly one of the worst airlines I have had to use. Annoyingly they have very good routes across Europe but that is where the positives end. Their App is clunky, not intuitive, and is featureless. You struggle to check in using it, get any meaningful data from it (if you can log in at all), Now, lets go into the travel experience itself.  BA are masters of making even the shortest flight a true long-haul experience.  I have traveled with them extensively across Europe on business and the flights are in the main, delayed.  They appear to offer regular flights to the same destination, giving the illusion of choice.  On many occasions I have booked the flight in the middle of the afternoon, only to arrive to a delay due to technical issues.  As you approach the flight time of the latter flight, you can board with an anticipated departure time of the later flight.  You are then told that due to a full service, certain groups have to then check hand luggage into the hold, free of charge (where normally they would charge £75) Many fellow travelers have also witnessed this and suggested that two flights are being merged into one as neither were sold out.  The flights appear to be very overpriced compared to other airlines who offer a less frequent service but with the delays I have experienced, I think it would be better to book these in the future as I never appear to arrive when scheduled, which makes it a challenge to meet colleagues flying in from other parts of Europe on more reliable services.  The inflight experience is equally disappointing, After paying a substantial amount for the fare, you are presented with a minute bottle of water and a snack you can pick up in Aldi for £0.79 for 10.  I don't normally use this site to leave negative reviews, but as I am currently sat in a European airport that is the temperature of a kiln as there is no air conditioning, with another delay, I thought as I had more time to kill I would vent my frustration.  As an aside, I was delayed flying out to the same destination yesterday.  Many of my European colleagues still remark what a great airline BA is and I joke that they clearly haven't flown with them for years.  Such a shame, used to be the envy of much of the aviation world. Sadly, not so much these days.

Only when we arrived at the gate were we told that the flight was full and we needed to go to the next flight 2.5 hours later. As a hindsight, our fault was that we did not buy our seats.

Our plane was then de-boarded at 10pm at night.  BA said they couldn't help anyone and we would all need to make our own arrangements for accommodation (at 10pm), transport, food etc.  They said we would need to front the costs and they would refund us for the above.  
BA automatically booked us onto another flight due to depart 3 DAYS LATER!  This flight involved a layover in Chicago where we were previosuly direct, AND would land on Monday meaning we would both miss work. After having it out with them over a skype call, we managed to at least get them to put us on a flight 1 day earlier, which had a change in dublin.  WHY WASNT THIS THE DEFAULT?... 
Anyway we are now 5 MONTHS on from our trip and are still yet to have our claim even reviewed.  We are owed nearly £2k in total for UK261 compensation, accommodation, food, transport etc.  There is no-one to talk to apart from a crappy chatbot.

We have called multiple times to get more information and the people we have spoken to have been unhelpful and in some cases patronising and very insensitive towards my wife. The person my wife talked to yesterday effectively lied to her by saying the bags were located when that wasn't the case according to who she spoke to this morning. It has been nearly two days since they flew and we are no closer to sorting it. 

I understand that these things happen but the response from BA has been terrible. Considering this was a mistake from their company I would have expected that there would have been a stronger desire to help us. It is especially disappointing as a 20-month-old child has none of the items she needs and no car seat as we haven't been able to hire one. This has caused both my wife and me considerable stress, especially as I am not with them to help. The customer service we have experienced has been disgraceful and once this is sorted I doubt we will ever fly with them again.

I was in the queue for two hours and no British airways staff had ever come to give any information to any one  about their flights. Finally it was my turn and they said it is too late for me to board as I have check-in bag. They told me that they change my flight to China eastern airline 20：50 tomorrow. I checked online about the flight they moved me to. Only China southern has flights at 20：50. Then I had to call British airways and China southern to check. Now I know it is China southern. Customers pay their tickets and has to check and verify everything is correct. British airways' service in Heathrow is terrible. My delay is purely caused by their bad service and management. The average check-in time for each check-in counter per customer is at least 30 minutes. Ths staff were always on the phone as they try to move customers to different flights.

"To summarize, I was denied boarding at the last moment at the Dubai airport, being told that I did not have the required transit visa for my layover in London. This information was never provided to me when I booked the ticket, and with a layover of only 1 hour and 40 minutes in the same terminal, I believe this requirement should have been made clear upfront.

The denial of boarding forced me to book a last-minute ticket on another airline, for which I had to pay a significantly higher price. Additionally, I had purchased extra baggage allowance with British Airways, and was unable to get a refund for this. The cascading effect of missing my original flight also led to me having to cancel and rebook ground transportation at my destination, further adding to my expenses.

While British Airways has refunded half the cost of my original ticket, this does not come close to covering the substantial financial losses I have incurred due to your airline's failure to inform me of the transit visa requirement. I am requesting full reimbursement for the additional flight and baggage costs, as well as compensation for the wasted transportation expenses.
I will never use British Airways again, and I strongly discourage anyone from doing business with them. This level of poor customer service and lack of accountability is simply unacceptable.",1.0,Dubai,London,International,July 2024,N/A,N/A,N/A,1.0,1.0,N/A,1.0,N/A

We were advised that we cannot have any drink or food for the afternoon because we were not airborne yet. We sat in our seats for 4 hours waiting for takeoff.The mistreatment started even before we embarked on our flight we were placed in buses after check- in due to 'shortage of landing slot' and we had to carry our hand luggage onto he plane climbing the stairs to the plane.

I believe that an establishment and advanced airline like BA should prepare and manage unforseen circumstances like that. 
 What I have noticed is that British Airways have no respect for Ghanaian travellers due to the current monopoly of being the only airline that goes directly to Ghana.

I know this will do nothing probably, but I will try my best to ruin this company and tell everyone how unhelpful, rude, patronising their members are and how glitchy and simply cheap their IT system is.

Flights cancelled. They had known since 1pm as the first flight in the morning was 5 hours late (technical problems). Same aircraft, to avoid knock on effect, cancelled hours later. They told us at 17.05 via mail while we were all in the airport, claiming adverse weather.

After this pleasant surprise, the odyssey of having to get your suitcase back (which of course did not happen) and having to deal with short staffed, rude, people from BA in the ground,being given conflicting info from different members of BA, made queue for 20min in three separate occasions for no reason whatsoever if not to discover that the machines could not retrieve suitcases from flights that have not departed from the airport (good to know, because the BA guy did not).

Absolute shambles. I will never, ever fly with you again (apart from the rebooked flight that, by the way, I had to book myself and there was no offer to rebook it for me) and I I will make sure to talk ill of you at any given occasion.

"Our flight was  scheduled to leave Heathrow to go to Geneva at 8.00pm but due to bad weather was delayed to 9.57pm.  Boarding was completed by 10.10. shortly afterwards the pilot announced that there was a risk that the flight would be cancelled because Geneva airport does not accept flights after 11.30pm. 

At 10.30  the  pilot apologized that the flight was in fact cancelled and that the passengers would need to disembark and would have to collect their luggage. He also announced that flights would be allocated, and that there would be BA staff in the airport to advise on hotels and rebooking flights with BA and other airlines. 

30 minutes later the pilot announced that he had made an error by letting the luggae be taken off the plane before the passengers. This meant that the passengers could no longer disembark at the front of the plane as there was a risk that the plane could tip over so we had to wait more than 45
minutes for steps to be found to take passengers out of the back of the plane. The pilot also announced that our luggage would be on carousel 8. 
When  we arrived at the luggae claim only two BA staff members were in the area who had no clue on how to advise passengers other than check for emails from BA or go onto BA.com. One of the two disappeared very quickly and was not seen again leaving the remaining employee to manage countless passengers from several canceled flights. Also, the luggage arrived at carousel area 10 without any notification. Finally we were advised fo go to the Customer service area in the arrivals where there would be staff through the night to help advise the passengers on next steps. When we arrived at 1.30am there were no BA staff to be seen. Yet another lie!

We ended up waiting until 4:30 with all the other passengers experiencing the same problem until a human being from BA showed up and at that point, we were told they could do nothing for us at the airport and that any rebooking had to be done online!! No voucher for hotel or meal were provided. We were booked for 3 days later and supposed to find a hotel and pay for it by ourselves! It’s horrendous that British Airways treat people with such little respect. Not a word of apology, no concrete advice only excuses and sending people left right and center to avoid taking responsibility.

They ended up giving us food passes to spend there of £15. We waited by the gate to hear further information as we had no communication why or when we were going to fly. The 2 women at the gate were about to leave without informing anyone of what’s going on. I asked her and she said you will not be flying today and will be notified shortly on when you can. I had to inform other passengers of the situation who were extremely disappointed as we had no communication all day. I had to miss a whole day of work the next day. We heard an announcement the flight was cancelled and waited a few more hours to find out what to do. A worker lead all about 160 of us to collect our luggage back which took around an hour and then left us without informing us what to do next. We had to identify other passengers and just follow them and were told to check in our names at gate 22 which we waited in a que for around 2 hours. We then we’re told to wait by McDonald’s for someone to come and inform us further. We waited for around an hour or so again and 3 members of staff asked us what hotel we were staying at. We explained we don’t know and haven’t even been told yet. They couldn’t find our names on the list and made us wait around another hour before getting on a coach to a hotel, this took around 35 mins and was at about 8pm.

We got another batch of food vouchers yet again which only worked in 2 cafes which the food was not nice and we waited around yet again. Us passengers kept checking up on each-other to see if anyone had an update as the airport was so poor with communication. A group of girls spotted the flight attendants and pilot eating lunch and asked them for an update and explained our awful situation. The BA staff said how awful they felt for us and that they didn’t realise the communication was so poor and that we will be leaving in around half hour. The flight got called and we were informed of which gate. We checked in our passports and queued for around an hour for a shuttle to take us to the aircraft. Once we got on the aircraft we were all so grateful and then the pilot announced we would have to wait inside the plane for 3 hours and 40 minutes due to there being no slots at Gatwick. As you can guess everyone was so unhappy and fed up at this point. The cabin crew gave out waters and tiny granola bars. The pilot announced he has good news and we will be able to take off in an hour instead, this never happened and actually took over  4 hours and we didn’t hear any sort off announcement again the whole time. There was a very large group of school kids from Italy who obviously were very bored and confused so ended up being out of their seats alot and talking amongst themselves, one flight attendant who was very rude started arguing with them and said “if you guys don’t be quiet, im going to go over to the pilot and get him to remove you off this flight”. She had no sympathy for the fact we had all been waiting around for 2 days with no communication at all. The flight finally took off. At the end of the flight the pilot announced we had to stay in the air for 15 mins as there was still no slot yet. We landed, they turned the seatbelt sign off and as expected everyone stood up ready to go. The rude flight attendant demanded everyone sit back in their seats with such a rude tone. The pilot announced we have to wait on the plane for at-least 15 minutes as the tube to connect the flight to the airport wasn’t ready and that they are extremely understaffed there. The pilot confirmed they will pay for everyone’s taxis home and hotels if needed. We finally got off the plane and went to collect our luggage, there were loads of people sat there even sleeping on the baggage machines and some confirmed they had been waiting there for over 3 hours, we then had to wait around 30-45 mins to collect our bags. Overall the whole entire journey was dreadful and so poorly communicated.",1.0,Cagliari,London,Europe,August 2024,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0

"My partner and I travelled with BA to Las Vegas.  When we booked our flights our travel agent contacted BA to explain that I have to follow a diet that is both gluten free and vegetarian for medical reasons.  BA wouldn't acknowledge both conditions - I had to select one or the other - so I selected gluten free, and arranged for a note be added to my booking stating that I also needed my food to be vegetarian.  But, on the flights my meals contained meat and fish, which had been put on top of the vegetables, so I couldn't eat anything.  I asked whether they had any snacks that were suitable but was told they don't usually carry gluten free snacks.  The flight over was 10 hours and back was 8 hours - which is a really long time to go without food.  I am absolutely disgusted that it was too much trouble for BA to acknowledge that I have 2 dietary conditions.  I did, after all, pay my money, the same as everyone else, but didn't get the same level of service.

"Awful. Took the flight one way and was poor - seat broken, no working usb ports on any of four seats, food was utterly atrocious. Then coming back they cancelled my flight and I have not had ANY contact from them at all. Only found out via my travel agent 24 hours before. Eventually managed to talk to someone, very pleasant but unable to help much. They claimed there were no premium seats on the equivalent flight but my agent told me there were - literally at the same time. But my agent also told me BA wouldn’t authorise those airlines (BA told me the seats didn’t ‘show’). So I was left with the choice from BA of downgrading on another airline or adding a change and around ten hours to the flight. Asked more than once why it had been cancelled. Still no answer.  Still trying to work out how to refund my seat reservations as website not responding at all. Just appalling all round. I used to love flying BA (and did regularly) never again.

"American Airline and British Airways Review:
My family traveled to the UK for the Wedding of my niece which was held on July 26th at 1500 in London. We were originally booked on AA2979/23 July BNA - CLT to connect with AA734/23 July CLT - LHR. Our flight was delayed due to weather and we arrived approximately 2345. We were rebooked on AA 1937 / 23  July CLT - BOS to connect to AA6981 BOS -LHR. The crew no showed and the flight was cancelled at approximately 0200 / 24 July. The counter sent out vouchers for hotels and meals and NO ONE was able to open and the error read 'There was a problem processing the request for hotel offerings' The gate agent advised they could not assist and left. We found a hotel and paid $115.25 for the night. The Taxi to the hotel cost $57,90 and the return cab cost $73.20. We then traveled AA848/24Jul CLT - PHL to connect with BA66 PHL - LHR. We were assured SEVERAL times that our bags were on board the flights as the BA app showed the bags were still in CLT. We had breakfast in CLT for $34.93 and lunch in PHL for $57.31. I check with a customer service agent who claimed he was a supervisor who advised us our bags were in CLT and we would have to file a claim with BA upon arrival at LHR and that the bags were still in CLT. He advised he had previously worked in baggage and could access the screen but he could do nothing to assist as we were now on BA (NOT OUR CHOICE). He also could not understand why we had not just been rebooked for CLT to LON for 24th and that there would not have been any issues with bags. When we arrived in LHR T5 there were no bags and AA would not accept our claim so we made a claim with British Airways. We were given a claim number and told to buy toiletries, make up and clothing until bags delivered. On July 26th, the day of the wedding I called and was advised that 2 bags had been located at AA T3 and would take 48 hours to process and deliver and that if I wanted to come to LHR and pick up. I took the Elizabeth Line to LHR T3 and was advised disruption on all service back to London due to rail work and an accident. When I arrived at T3 I was told to go to a customer service phone and call AA. I called and wait for someone to answer for 20 min. I then saw an AA baggage person walk by and he took me to an area where I would go through Customs to get to Baggage. AA rep claimed no knowledge of my bags and I finally spoke with a manager that actually looked and computer and advised bags were at carousel 2. She walked me through Customs  to AA agent Raj who said for me to go look at carousel 2. My bags were not there. I returned and asked Raj to check computer and help. I had 3hours till the wedding. Raj refused and advised not AA problem and I had to speak with British Airways rep who was literally sitting next to him. The BA agent walked around with me and checked backs for about 45 min. When we returned to counter 1 of my bags was sitting in front of Raj's position. When asked how back appeared he advised he had no idea and not his issue!!!!! I took bag and took taxi back to London hotel. AFTER the wedding the second bag arrived at hotel. On July 27th I received a voice message from PHL lost and found advising I had 5 days to pick up my bag or it would be sent to a warehouse. I called BA and was advised their system would not allow them to be able to assist and contact AA. 
AA advised unable to assist as claim was with BA! On evening of Sunday July 28th, I received a call from an AA baggage agent in PHL advising that they had bag and would forward to LHR. I request bag be returned to my house as I was returning next day and would miss delivery. I was advised BA need to send message to reroute the bag. BA advised unable to assist. We returned to LHR T3 to return on AA733/30Jul LHR-CLT x AA2979/30July CLT-BNA. Upon check in I spoke with an AA manager who advised me to go to Customer Service desk and file claim with AA as claim should have been handled by AA. I went to Customer Service Desk and agent refused to take a claim and advised Ian was not his manager. BA agent right next to AA (One World), advised unable to assist. In total frustration I went on AA AI chat and within 30 min AI Chat arranged for my 3rd bag to be delivered to my house before I arrived from LHR. Normally I am not an AI advocate but I cannot wait for all these incompetent AA and BA agents to be replaced with AI as it seems their main function is to move you along and get you to just give up. Now for the fun part! I am trying to get reimbursed  for my Hotel in Charlotte, taxies, meals, toiletries and clothing (Total $1642.21 & I can provide all receipts). BA claims my claim number is not valid even though I can pull it up on their website. American Airlines system does not allow me to file for all charges together and I have reached out via their website for assistance as everyone I have called has given me the run around. Please if someone from American Airlines or British Airways with any type of authority please reach out to me! My contact details will be found on either my record locater NUHGWJ or claim number LHRBA41654.",1.0,Nashville,London,International,July 2024,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,3.0

Our daughter and family were offered an earlier flight, again from Heathrow (and not the booked flight from Gatwick) this again is an earlier flight and not only affecting car hire and airport parking but also involves a diversion to Dublin!

She is being diverted to Dublin with an 8 hour wait in Dublin hence arriving late at night at Faro with a one year old, two year old and an 8 year old. This is absolutely disgusting service and has already taken the shine off a well planned holiday. Obviously this is all out of our control and we are not even at the airport yet when we might face further disruption. There is absolutely no excuse for such appalling organisation on BA’s part.

"What a nightmare! 
On June 22, 2024, I flew BA business class from LHR to Accra. Just as we were set to take off, we were alerted of a mechanical fault . They tried for three hours with no success. In the end, we had to leave the plain and put on another. 

My flight was delayed by approximately eight hours. We arrived in Accra, Ghana, at around 2 a.m. on June 23rd, rather than 6.30 p.m. on June 22nd. To my horror, my bags had not arrived. I departed the airport about 3 a.m. after completing my Property Irregularity Report (PIR) for missing bags. I was told that the bag will be on the next day's flight. 

It's been seven days and I still haven't received my luggage. I emailed BA in London about my missing bag and called BA staff in Accra several times, but to no avail. 

I even sent them photos of my packed suitcase, as well as the necessary information to assist them in locating my luggage, but no positive results were returned. When I call the help desk in Accra, all they tell me is that 'the suitcase has not in Accra and that they are searching for it' . They even had the arrogance to ask me to come to the airport and look for it. The insensitivity is astounding. Customer service is nonexistent.

I cannot comprehend how BA can misplace a bag with a priority tag on it. I'm so stressed out. I still hope to hear some positive news from BA.

"Had to select a month for 'when did you fly' - but the reality is we didn't, because four months after booking it we received an email telling us that our flight was cancelled. No reason given. Advised to contact them to discuss alternative options - fine in principle, except that every time I have called them now for three weeks (approx 10 times) you get through (eventually) to an automated message that says they 'are unusually busy' and to 'call back later' - good luck with that. So you go online to use their 'chat' function - except that is AI-automated too - after about 5 mins you get to indicate you want to chat to a human being - you're 99+ in the queue. You try again the next day you're 74th in the queue. So you write an email to complain and ask for advice about refunds etc. 16 days after your email you get a 2 sentence response which is useless. For context 6 months ago my sister similarly had a BA flight cancelled with no reason. I used to pay a premium to use BA - no more - they really are just as bad as Ryanair. The customer service of Easyjet is far better. Just look at the BA Trustpilot score now.

"Had a business trip in which I had also covered for (3) customers for an event in our factory.  No issues with the flight going out.  Upon arrival, the pilot comes on to tell us the bags did not make the flight.  They made the decision to send everyone without their bags.  I had to spend (2) hours at the airport in Venice with (2) ladies being the only people able to process claims.  The online system had a systems error leading everyone back to the same input page (so no online option).  Calls into have people help resulted in getting sent to the online page which was broken.  So I am inconvenienced to having to arrive at my hotel around 1:30 at night, no baggage, no opportunity to get clothes or personal care for my business meetings for the next two days.  I missed part of my meetings the following day trying to get clothes and personal care items.  Fast forward to trying to leave Italy.  I had an economy flight ticket, but I have Silver Status with BA.  When I checked in online at night I had indicated no bag - which is correct, I had no bag.

At the airport - lucky me, I was able to purchase a bag.

"We booked London to Los Angeles flight months in advance and fully paid, was an expensive flight too as I paid $1000+ more to fly on Airbus A380. We had problem checking in online, no explanation given, just says system error. This is 10+ days after Crowdstrike so no excuses. We arrive at Heathrow 3.5 hours before departure. Insane queue, none of their kiosks worked, lots of angry confused passengers all around, totally disorganized, whilst I see BA employees and gate agents casually milling about, misdirecting people, ignoring urgent pleas from people, etc, generally rude and unhelpful. They tell us flight is oversold but give us boarding pass without assigned seat, says to go to gate anyway and take our chances. They oversold by 16 seats and me and my wife were two of 4 unlucky people left behind. Again zero explanations or apologies given. None of the people are the hate cared, just brushed off our pleas for help. Plenty of people who arrived at airport and at gate behind us got to board. Mind you we are US citizens and speak perfect English, and were at no time rude or disrespectful; we followed all instructions given by BA and airport staff. Anyway after our flight takes off, finally the gate manager tries to help us: booked us an immediate flight to Paris to connect with an Air France flight: about 5 hours delay arrival vs original flight but acceptable to us. They give us boarding pass for London-Paris and vouchers told us to see Air France in Paris to get boarding for Paris-LA. We literally ran across to other side of Heathrow, board BA flight to Paris (which was 30 minutes late), ran across CDG terminal 2C to connect with Air France at 2E, only to be told by AF their flight is full and BA vouchers useless. AF told us to go back to BA counter at 2C because were their problem. We run back to BA at 2C to be told they can’t help as they don’t have manager their and can’t rebook us and we need to call BA. They won’t provide phone number and told us to check BA.com. Wife calls BA, on hold for 30min, finally phone to tell us go back to AF again. We go back to AF and finally they helped us get on next day AF flight to LA. The last couple AF ladies were only people who were helpful. Add insult to injury, BA gate had made us check in one of our carry-ons (which we flew with for years as carryon piece wo problems) on London to Paris flight, bc it was “full” flight and won’t have any room onboard (there was plenty of overhead room left) assuring us it will arrive direct to LAX w AF. Because we can’t board AF, for several hours I had to track down where at CDG is my luggage bc the luggage tag barcode scan came up empty and not in system per CDG luggage official. No help by BA in helping us book overnight hotel at CDG. All we got was the apology letter I attached below: literally most humiliating experience of my life. The entire day BA treated us like second class citizens; even though we did everything right and waited patiently and followed all their instructions.

I approached the desk and asked what the issue was and the lady at the desk called a manager down who said he couldn’t over ride the issue and check her in as she’s under 2, so I simply said, “so just check me and my husband in, leave my daughter as if she’ll be on our lap, then when we take off we will have the seat next to us as we have bought it” he quickly realised this was the most logical resolution and continued to begin to check us in, out of frustration my husband simply said “we’ve had the most awful experience with this, nobody at BA knows what they are doing” and I agreed and said “nobody knows what they are doing” .. we were expecting an apology for the nightmare we’ve had, instead the manager stopped what he was doing, said I was being rude, (not my husband, just me)… said he’s not going to check us in and we can wait for being rude apparently… so I went up close to him and said you absolutely have no right not to check us in for being frustrated after the nightmare we’ve had, we have rights … he proceeded to say I needed a “gas mask” or “muzzle”… I was absolutely gobsmacked and quickly reached for my phone, started to record him and ask him what mask I needed? He quickly retracted as he saw I was recording and quickly checked us in! ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING BEHAVIOUR… the most sexist disgusting treatment gunning for me and not my husband who originally said “nobody knows what they are doing” which is TRUE!!!!

"Case Number 02338330

When dropping off my luggage at the luggage drop off at Toulouse airport, I had my travel pram confiscated from me and I was forced to take my sleeping 2 year old in my arms while traveling alone with him at 5.30am. I was told by the staff outsourced by British Airways to check in passengers (therefore an extension of your company) that only yoyo prams were accepted on board. I corrected her that it was 'yoyo type' prams but she contested and told me that only yoyo prams would be allowed and if I insisted to keep my sleeping 2-year-old in his pram I would not be permitted to board the flight to London. This happened to 2 other families (that I know of) and we were forced to go to the oversized baggage area of the airport. To clarify my pram is the Silver Cross Jet stroller pushchair which I specifically purchased as it is conform to the British Airways specifications. I was then required to carry my toddler for 30 mins through security, and then again for another 40 mins while waiting to board the plane (I was 'allowed' early boarding only to be moved from my seat to stand on the other side of the staff with no more options to sit down). At Heathrow, I was then required to carry my toddler again for approx. 40 mins to go through passport check and luggage claim (as mentioned previously, I was traveling alone with my child with no other support). All this, despite purchasing a very expensive pram to fit to your requirements and coming to the airport prepared with this pram. I'm sure you agree this is unacceptable and it is illegal to force passengers to purchase a specific brand of products in order to be able to keep their child in their travel pram. It is also illegal to discriminate against passengers because they have 'dared' to travel with children. 

In addition to this, once on the plane, I installed my Kids Fly Safe Cares Child Airplane Safety Harness for my son. The cabin crew then proceeded to tell me this was not allowed. I had to go on the website to show them that this was incorrect and I was in fact within my rights. Then, for landing, your crew had the gall to tell me to put the harness on my son and that it was 'mandatory' to which I asked, if it was mandatory why did I bring the harness myself. It is also important to note that my son was not given a life jacket when boarding the plane which is against regulation.

Basically, I was treated like a criminal during my entire journey and my crime was having a toddler. British Airways is by far the most discriminatory airline for parents traveling with children and this needs to change immediately, especially considering that I paid the same price as an adult for my 2-year-old to be on that flight and he was treated like an inconvenience.

My advice; don't treat a mom traveling alone at 5am with a sleeping toddler like rubbish, and don't confiscate her travel pram that is within regulation forcing her to have the worst travel experience possible.",1.0,Toulouse,London,Europe,June 2024,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

Flew to and from Mauritius on BA July 2024. Flights left and landed on time. They use B 777 aircraft on these routes..leg room and seat pitch in economy isn't great.

"I had the worst travel experience with British Airways, and I've traveled with several airlines before to numerous destinations.  None, I repeat NONE, of BA's flights were on-time.  They were all delayed including a rescheduled flight that was assigned to us after missing a connecting flight due to their delays.  We traveled from the U.S. to LHR and from there we had a connecting flight to our final destination - the flight was delayed leaving the U.S. and we were delayed at LHR on the tarmac waiting for shuttle buses AND we were put through the main security checkpoint.  As a result we missed the connecting flight.  We were given a new flight in order to make it to our final destination the same day but even that flight was delayed (since that flight involved a connection we couldn't  take the flight since the delay would have caused us to miss the connection).  On the way back to the U.S., the flight out of the city we were leaving to LHR was delayed by at least an hour.  Horrible experience.  BA's inefficiency, most likely incompetence from LHR and BA, caused us to miss a very expensive hotel night at our first destination which the travel insurance refused to cover.  I made a claim with BA and still waiting to hear back.  BA should look at their data and see how often they're delayed, if the data says that they are often delayed then BA should strongly consider having longer layovers for connecting flights as to avoid passengers missing those connecting flights.

"The flight departure was a few hours late, which happens. There were some technical issues with the aircraft (a Boeing 787,  so no surprise there), followed by an ATC delay. I was lucky enough to have a brilliant member of crew looking after me, called Alberto, Méxican based and who only flew this route. 
The seats, once so innovative, are so dated now, especially if in the aisle and with a huge noisy lump of a person adjacent who had no sense of his personal geography. Nonetheless I managed a sleep. 
This was just as well, since on approaching México City, we were informed from the flight deck that it wasn't safe to make an approach due to adverse weather conditions and that we would divert to Cancun over an hour away. That we did, and picked up fuel and after more technical problems (Boeing, don't forget) we left for México City, landing over 5 hours late. 
I was intrigued to know what weather condition prohibited an approach. All I could think of was unbelievably strong crosswinds, a massive and persistent storm, or fog. Nope. Temperature. It was, the flight deck informed us, too hot to attempt a safe approach. Since México City almost never records temperatures above 25 degrees after dusk, that was a most strange explanation. Indeed, I found, on departure from the airport, that the only divert that evening had been our aircraft. I then pieced events together. The landing at Cancun had been very hard (typical of a wet field landing) but nothing like the one in México City. The approach itself was bizarre, with constant engine surges, and there was no round out at the last stages, or flare of any sort. It was flung onto the runway, and it was so hard my pelvis was hurt. I came to the conclusion that there was a failure in either the leading edge slats or the flaps. 
Look, these things happen, and the flight crew did the sensible thing. It was though, somewhat discreditable to disguise the technical issue and blame it on temperature. My only extra cost was a taxi as the next metro was a few hours later. I made a decision some time ago to avoid operations with Boeing products about a year ago for safety reasons, so my long haul trips are with Iberia (frankly a far better product in every respect than BA) when heading west and Finnair (ditto) when heading east. BA is great on shorthaul. That said, if BA ever replaces its Airbus types with Boeing on shorthaul, then I'll be flying TAP to Portugal and Iberia to Spain. Boeing is simply a dreadful product, with noisy 777s and I just don't trust the engineering.",3.0,London,Mexico City,International,July 2024,5.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,4.0

"Disappointing both in the lounge and in the plane

Lounge was poor food and service. Seating not very comfortable

The plane was awful with no extra leg room, poor comfort and design

Service was slow and not differentiated in Club as it used to be.

Stewardess did not take my jacket to hang up in locker as in the old days and no concept of serving the customer evident

Seating is three abreast and it looks like they keep the middle empty in Club

We were in row 3 from memory and they had already run out of one meal choice by the time they got to us So 8 people served and O/O/S of the charcuterie option. 
Told by stewardess that they only had 2 to start with and had to avoid waste hence limited range/stock!

No curtain to separate Club from the economy cabin and for 80% of the flight we had passengers queuing in the aisle to use the toilet at the front of the plane
Staff made no attempt to control this intrusion into what should be a tranquil atmosphere for the extra money.

"Hello there, 

I already filed a case/complaint regarding my booking K887KL but I haven't received any email from BRITISH AIRWAYS SO FAR! This means I haven't received my case ID number yet! No response from BA TILL DATE!

Next regarding my trip - booking K887KL experience of 2 Passengers 

Overall experience: TOO BAD and I never going to fly with British Airways anymore!!! I am DONE WITH YOUR WORST SERVICE! 

To know more read as follows., 

PLANNED: Initially I booked a flight directly at British Airways from AMSTERDAM to LONDON (BA429) and then from LONDON to CHENNAI (BA35) but then this flight was canceled and rebooked to AIR INDIA flight as follows.

CANCELLED & REEBOOKED(1):
Amsterdam to Delhi (AI156) then Delhi to Bangalore (AI506) then again from Bangalore to Chennai (AI585). This is too bad and I have a lot of internal transit and the timing is very late to the planned schedule. So I called BA to look for a different alternative and spent 2 hours on a phone call (cost 22 EURO) and found an alternative as follows.,

REBOOKED(2): AMSTERDAM to MUMBAI (KL0877) and then MUMBAI to CHENNAI (KL3686). Later when I called my taxi to change the time that cost me 80EUR and to reach the airport cost me 120 EUR. When the journey started AMSTERDAM to MUMBAI (KL0877) but the food was not good as the Airline already decided themself that they would not provide any Non-vegetarian meal and they only provided vegetarian meal but I was thinking how they would decide what I MUST EAT! But overall it was ok and found no major issues but then when I reach MUMBAI to catch my next flight i started to having problems.

Problem 1:  From my original booking when my baggage are checked in in AMSTERDAM then I have no issues and it will be picked up at my final destination CHENNAI by (BA35) luggage belt. But here I have to pick up checked-in baggage in MUMBAI Airport from (KL0877) belt and again I need to find the Indigo Airlines desk and drop them off as a fresh check-in for the next flight (KL3686). This was also not communicated by British Airways or by KLM Airways and i understood this from my neighbour's passenger!!! Which is very strange!!! Why BA is not responsible for this?

Problem 2: But unfortunately one of the check-in baggage (hard case) was broken during handling. Then I tried to approach KLM Airlines (KL0877) belt to raise a baggage claim but they told me I booked via British Airways so BA has to cover my loss!!! But I didn’t see the British Airways counter to report the issue and with the limited time, I rushed to reach INDIGO Airlines to drop my bags again in checkin!!!

Problem 3: When I tried to get my next flight and to finish my check-in the people in the desk of Indigo Airlines told me that the ticket was canceled by KLM Airways or by British Airways then I contacted British Airways and they said “no the tickets are not canceled” and I am good to go and British airways sent me again email confirmation that the flights are not canceled. Then i showed the 2nd email confirmation to the Indigo Airlines desk and they said “no we have no confirmed ticket” (they showed me from their computer) to reach my final destination. Then again i called BA to cross check and they are now saying “yes sorry to say it was canceled” and they don't know who canceled those tickets - it could be by Indigo Airlines/KLM Airlines/British Airlines NO ONE KNOWS to date and the irritating thing was it was not even communicated to me as a passenger via my email address or message!!! I was literally blank and got a severe headache and became ill in the MUMBAI Airport. Then I had a coffee and a headache pain reliever tablet from the Appolo Pharmacy! Then finally after 2 hours of phone call (cost 22 EURO)  with BA with several arguments and issues BA said that somehow this flight (KL3686) was canceled without being communicated so they managed to book my next flight!

CANCELLED & REBOOKING (3): Now I have rebooked the flight to (UK0821) by VISTARA Airways from Mumbai to Chennai. Then I took all my baggage to reach the VISTARA Airlines counter and dropped by check-in baggage and marked one of the luggage with a Fragile sticker because it was already broken in Mumbai Airport from the KLM Belt! Now the irritating problem is I was supposed to reach my final destination Chennai Airport according to my initial plan was at 3:30 AM by British Airways (BA35) then it got changed to 05:10 by Indigo Airways (KL3686)  but now i reached Chennai Airport at 08:55 (UK0821).

Problem 4: Now due to this cancelation and change in flight I was already in a headache and became ill so I reached the walk-in lounge and I had to spend 3000INR = 50 EUR (Including currency conversion & transaction fee) to take some nap due to my illness!

NOTE: If you see how much I got into trouble as a customer I literally already decided NOT TO FLY ANYMORE WITH BRITISH AIRWAYS if I do not get my compensation - REFUND MY FULL ticket, Cover all my Expenses, and if not I am ready to file a case in consumer court for Justice!!!

I have enough proof for all and therefore I request you to REFUND MY entire journey ticket cost!!!",1.0,Amsterdam,Chennai (Madras),International,July 2024,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"I find it interesting and very telling that BA do not comment on the posts shown here. We flew into Gibraltar yesterday for a 10 day holiday in Spain. Firstly, I don't like to complain without good reason. BA have lost all 4 of my family's suitcases. We have received no email, no text, no communication whatsoever. I have had to wait in a virtual online queue to speak to someone. The first time I was cut off. The online portal asked me to add my personal details even though I had given those on the form at Gibraltar and watched them entered onto a system. The second online 'chat * I was informed that I had not added my details and was the reason  I had not been contacted by BA. I asked that someone call me but received a response that the request would be passed on. No confirmation that this would happen, no interest in how we were managing with two children and no luggage whatsoever. We had tried to check our bags at terminal 3. We had checked in online but were still told to join a queue of people who hadn't checked in. The que was not moving at all and at this point our flight was less than an hour away. My husband enquired as the terminal staff were not telling people anything. My husband was curly told they were carrying out 'special checks'. Then the conveyor belts stopped working and although we had at this point checked our bags they would not go through. We were told to remove them and take them to Area D and that they would be collected manually. Clearly this did not happen. We have had to buy clothing and toiletries and the first day of our holiday was ruined. We have still received no correspondence and there is no direct number to call. I imagine we will have to go shopping again to buy clothing as we bought only the essentials. This impact financially upon us and our holiday. I will have to spend today chasing BA for an update and will probably be stuck speaking to an online assistant, who although were very lovely, can do little to help as I don't believe the call centre in in the UK and they work to a script .

We came to the terminal 3 hours early as expected but when we arrived there was a massive queue with 10 desks only 4 or 3 occupied making the queues longer .Considering they have there own designated terminal 5 in heathrow airport for british airways only surely this wouldn't be a problem.As we were checking there was a problem with one of our families visas .they told us this was uncommon but there were many many more people facing the same issue.we were stuck at the  desk for more than 2 hours once we were clear they did't let us onto the flight it was 12:30 at this time our flight was at quarter past so surely they could've fast tracked us through.Instead they decided to put 5 of us on standby.Later we discovered it was fully booked so we then opted out .still now they are not refunding our tickets after a lack of communication from the lady at the desk.she was sat there calling for her supervisor for over 15 mins.They are still not refunding out tickets .Do not fly with british airways it is truly poor.,1.0,London,Toronto,International,July 2024,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
"Following a flight home from Lanzarote to London Gatwick with a delay of nearly 3 hours before departure we were told we would have to land at Lisbon to refuel. On arrival in Lisbon the flight was cancelled due to the pilot and crew running out of flying hours. The delays were caused by a BA flight having to abort take off at London Gatwick earlier that day. They would have known this when in Lanzarote. We were treated appallingly - we were kicked
Off the plain and told ground staff would look after us - that was a bloody joke! There was no BA rep in the airport and after having been stood around in the airport with little or no information for over 4 hours we were eventually told to wait for the last coach which would take half an hour before getting to the airport to collect us and then we’d have a 45 minute journey to the hotel. Or we could find our own hotel and BA WOULD DEFINITELY REFUND OUR EXPENSES. We got to our hotel at 10.30pm where the hotel informed us we couldn’t have any food apart from what was in their vending machines.
We returned to the airport the following day to get a flight home and after waiting around for over 6 hours with no information, no food or drink we eventually managed to check in. We were then given a £15 voucher to spend on food and drink but by the time we got through security our gate was being called and we were told if we went and got refreshments we’d miss the plane because the gate was closing in 2 minutes. Imagine our disgust when we got to the plane to find half the passengers still hadn’t boarded because they were purchasing food and drink!! And then to add insult to injury the cabin crew member who was serving executive club passengers rounded up all the food and cans of drink as well as Prosecco and handed it out to them. She thought by closing the curtain we wouldn’t notice - REALLY! At this point in time the segregation of passengers should have been disbanded because we were all in the same position! Us peasants ended up with a cup of water and a bag of fish’n’ chip crisps!! Insulting is not the word.
I made a claim with BA over 3 weeks ago and it still hasn’t been processed - nor have my other family members received any money! We are all considerably out of pocket thanks to BA! And there’s no indication when we might even get our expenses/compensation.
I always thought BA was a good airline but they are worse than the low budget competitors! Don’t give them your money because they are a bunch of cowboys!!!! They treat animals on a flight better than humans (unless you’re flying executive class of course). They don’t even deserve a 1 star rating - I’d give them zero if I could!!! Thanks BA for giving us the most stressful end to a holiday we’ve ever experienced - you don’t deserve any customers!!

"Business class passengers removed to make room for cabin crew to rest during flight after short delay led to working time regulations being invoked! 

It turns out BA made a commercial decision (but a very poor customer service decision) not to fit a cabin crew rest area to 787 Dreamliners. Any delay of even a few minutes (as on our flight) means the cabin crew have no where to sleep on board. The answer, as far as BA is concerned, is to routinely bump 7 of 8 business class passengers out and also bump people out of Premium Economy to make room for them!! Understand, this means your business class seat or your premium economy seat is NOT guaranteed especially from the west coast of America or on any of BA's longer flights.

BA do not care about you as a customer - even a premium paying customer. BA do not care about their cabin crew - even those flying the furthest and working the longest hours. Instead of fitting a cabin crew rest area (like their competitors) they expect the cabin crew to remove premium customers and deal with the inevitable bad feeling and relational consequences before the flight can leave.

Very poor BA. The Executive team which made that commercial decision affecting premium paying  customers and their staff are a disgrace to air travel. Shame on you!

Planning to fly business class or premium economy on a BA long haul flight? Willing to risk it? Not me. Not again.

BA do not care about you or their staff. They only care about profits. BA is no longer a resilient airline. It can no longer deal with even short delays without causing chaos on board. My advice is not to risk it. There are plenty of other airlines available which have invested in rest areas for cabin crew.

"The employees weren't friendly nor very professional, but Athens to Heathrow was satisfactory from baggage drop through the flight. 
British Airways (BA) Business class intra Europe is a bit of a joke. It's the same seating as economy with the middle seat left empty. The plane interior was ratty and didn't appear very clean.
The crew was amiable. The food alright. Take off was with a less than 40 minute delay... very good by BA standards 

Once at Heathrow the usual surly anti customer BA attitude was back in full force. Ask for directions to the lounge, they will wave you away.
Go to the customer service to ask a question you are treated as if you are some sort of idiot wasting their time.

The departure gate wasn't posted until 35 minutes before the scheduled departure time and the departure gate was a posted 20 minute train ride away. You should have seen the panicked customers trying to squeeze into the one train that showed up after a 15 minute wait.
Once we all arrived at the 'remote' departures area we discovered there weren't any stores, restaurants, only 1 bathroom, and NO BA employees.

Gates were poorly marked and no employees but lots of announcements that boarding was in progress.

After 45 minutes we were 'allowed' to actually board... those of us who had figured how to access the boarding gates. Employees were present to rudely tell us we needed to move along.

Business class.
Entered through a dirty galley area. 1-2-1 herringbone seating
The upholstery on the seats was ragged, the carpet not tacked down, and the very limited storage areas dirty. The seat itself was narrower than a Southwest airlines seat.

"This is a review of the BA First Class Lounge at Heathrow
My three hour layover in this lounge gave me a lot of time to consider its myriad flaws and disappointments. The customer is definitely not at the center of what they do in this lounge:

SEATING/SERVICE
Good luck finding a clean spot to sit. Glasses and plates strewn everywhere. Passengers were having to clear tables themselves. Meanwhile staff were hanging around TV monitors watching either the soccer or cricket games that were playing at the time. 

FOOD
This is bad people. BA is not the 'world's airline' it claims to be when it comes to food. The buffet is a sad, sub-standard, sloppy, unappealing carb-dense array of classic British fare. A world away from the high quality offered by Qantas and Cathay in their First Class Lounges. American Airlines Flagship Lounges are 3 or 4 times better than BA First. Staff also fed from the buffet whisking their plates off to a nearby office to watch the soccer. Coffee machines were out of order, glasses were not restocked, everything was messy. 

RESTROOMS/SHOWERS
The number of showers and toilets is woefully deficient for the number of customers. Expect long waits for both.

British Airways - Singapore to Heathrow - Business class on an A380-800 is a Premium Economy Plus experience. From the economy class sized toilets to the badly designed coffin shaped Business class pods - the experience is a substandard business class experience. Business class pod’s storage is a small drawer at the FOOT of the pod. The ‘privacy’ screens are opaque plastic sheets - so you are kept awake by your neighbour as their screen lights up your pod. When the seat is made into its coffin shaped bed - the cold hard plastic seat moulds are an unpleasant surprise for those that turn in their sleep. You have a choice of having your neighbour step over your calf-height footrest - hopefully not brushing your feet with theirs - or having to step over your neighbour's feet/footrest. With the footrest down - heaven-forbid you try to lever yourself into a more comfortable position as the slightest pressure causes the footrest to collapse into its floor level position. If you are in the aisle seat - which is open to the aisle - kiss goodbye to any privacy as not only will you be on view to all passengers - the crew will lean you to both serve your neighbour their food and talk to your neighbour OVER YOUR PRIVACY SCREEN.,1.0,Singapore,London,International,July 2024,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,3.0

"My wife and I were booked to fly to Budapest on 1 June on the 09.15 flight.

	At about 0400 that morning I received a text message and email informing me that the flight had been cancelled for “operational reasons”. We had expected to arrive in Budapest at about 13.00 and travel into the city to take up our AirB&B booking.

	However, these messages from BA were subsequently updated and we were advised that we had been re-booked on a Finnair flight to Helsinki and then on to Budapest by another Finnair flight. This meant that we were not going to be able to contact our host’s agent at the time originally agreed and made what should have been a two-hour flight into daylong frustration. 

	On arriving at terminal 3 we approached the two ladies at the BA counter who were, to say the least, exceedingly arrogant and rude when asked to point us in the direction of the Finnair desks. They just pointed down the terminal.

	On arrival in Helsinki BA had not advised Finnair that we were wheelchair passengers which exacerbated the situation causing us, 86- and 84-year-olds considerable distress in finding the gates for our Budapest flight.

	
We finally arrived at the house in Budapest much later that evening only to be met by a rather grumpy agent who handed our keys to us and left as quickly as possible
                                                                                                                                                          
This sorry saga does not end here

Our return flight, BA 869, on 15 June Budapest>Heathrow was an even worse experience.

Before the flight there was some advice that there may be delays in London for unknown reasons. However, we were checked in and taken to the departure gate in wheelchairs by two very helpful Hungarian AMS staff who navigated us through immigration and security.

We were boarded, the doors were closed, and the captain announced that there was a delay of an hour for some reason. This hour turned into an even longer period before we began to taxi to the main runway.

Just short of the runway apron we stopped again and waited, and waited until the aircraft did a 360 degree turn around a grass island until the aircraft arrived back at the point it had been earlier.

The next thing was that the captain announced that there were now problems with the nose wheel and that we had to return to a parking area where the wheel could be examined by an engineer.  Again, we sat and waited and waited.
      
Finally, we were told that we would be returned to the terminal and disembarked. My wife and I were finally moved from the aircraft by a hoist and deposited in the departure hall.

From here things got even worse. There was no BA agent or employee anywhere in sight. It was left to a young Hungarian airport worker who spoke English to deal with all the passengers in the terminal, not just disgruntled BA passengers!

We were finally moved to the wheelchair holding area and realised that we had no idea of how or when we would be able to return to London. This was appalling!!!!!

Suddenly I had an email from BA apologising for the trouble but offering no assistance in resolving our situation. Ultimately, I found at the end of this email a UK telephone number. I managed to ring the number and was treated exceptionally well by a young man who appreciated our predicament and worked furiously to rebook us on the next BA flight out of Budapest. This was the only evidence of efficiency we experienced that day.

   	The saga did not end there as we had to go through Immigration and security yet again and our passport data would show that my wife and I actually left Budapest twice on the 15th of June

We finally arrived back in London at 22.00 that night, exhausted, both mentally and physically.

"On 24-April-2024, I bought an online ticket (LT9YIE) for 5 travelers (myself, spouse and 3 children) from British Airways website. My flight timing from Dubai to Heathrow was on 18-Jun-2024 @ 01:05AM.

On 10-Jun-2024, I received an email that my flight has been cancelled and re-booked on 18-Jun-2024 @ 12:05 PM. Due to this inconvenience, I had to cancel all my hotel  bookings where I planned for stay with my family.

On 18-Jun-2024, when I reached at Dubai airport with my family for boarding, a lady at boarding counter name Miss Sakina -Shift Manager told me that I can’t travel because I have long stay at Heathrow  Airport and I don’t have any permit to enter in London, so can’t stay long and we (British Airways) afraid that you might disappear, however, we (British Airways) will arrange another flight for you and family tonight to avoid long stay.

I tried to explain her that I have long travel history of different countries and if British Airways has such thinking about the passenger then why they don’t ask / tell the passenger at the time to purchase of the ticket. She did not answer any of my question and holed myself & my family at boarding counter almost 4 hours who spent sleepless night and reached at airport for fly.

During communication, Miss. Sakina – Shift Manager mentioned that we normally do this with Pakistani and Bangladeshi nationals and not allow them for long stay.  

My question here is with British Airways, is such RACISM is allowed in British Airways? Who allowed her to pass such statement? We are customers and we buy ticket for safe travel.

In addition to that she allegedly added my status in the system as “I will not return back”. Is that so simple to write such note without any proof. I am also asking this question from British  Airways management?

During this mishap, I missed my flight because Miss Sakina did not issue me boarding passes. Then I made a phone call to British Airway’s call center to file a complaint and from there they advised me to a book hotel in Dubai to stay there till next flight arrangement and British Airways will refund this hotel / accommodation expenses.  

I was really misbehaved especially by Miss Sakina. The way she treated, put wrong observation against me without any proof and showed RACISM.

After having conversation with CS, I booked a hotel in Dubai to wait for my next flight which was rebooked for 19-June-2024 @ 01:05AM.

Further, while returning back from Heathrow (London) to Dubai 0n 08-July-2024, I was also stuck around 4 to 5 hours to get my boarding passes. I was hold at boarding counter with my family without knowing any reason.

Now, I would request British Airways to mention me the reason of that inconvenience which I have not yet been told by boarding representative from British Airways.

I am also planning to highlight this legally at ICAO plat from if I don’t receive fare response and compensation against this mishap from British Airways.

I except that British Airways will take serious action of complain which will show how their justice system works.

I am available for 24/7 to answer any question raise by British Airways.

"Don't EVER fly British Airways. E-V-E-R!
Getting to Europe was not without hitches. We had a connecting flight in LHR (London) to CDG (Paris). Since our initial flight was delayed they bumped us off of our flight, which we still had plenty of time to make it onto. Nope, doesn't matter. 
So we ended up spending HOURS sitting in the airport. 

But that absolutely pales in comparison to their next move....

Last night we were supposed to be flying to London. But when we went to check in (2 1/2 hours early), we discovered they canceled our boarding passes. For the LAST FLIGHT OF THE DAY!!
Oh, but it gets even worse. After spending 3 hours on the phone with them, they got us on the first flight to London this morning. So we slept in the airport even though we paid for a nice hotel in London. 
Oh, but that's not the end of it, oh no. This morning we went to the gate, boarding passes in hand, seats assigned and everything... Only to be told they CANCELED US!!!!

"Very worst experience still not received baggage. 

I am writing to express my utter frustration and disappointment with your handling of my recent travel and the disgraceful customer service I have experienced.

On July 4, 2024, I flew from Mumbai to Austin via London Heathrow with British Airways (Flight Number: [Insert Flight Number]). The first leg went smoothly, but my flight from London to Austin was canceled due to technical issues. I was rebooked on a flight from London to Chicago with British Airways (Flight Number: [Insert Flight Number]) and then from Chicago to Austin with American Airlines (Flight Number: [Insert Flight Number]).

I checked in two bags in Mumbai, expecting to receive them in Austin. However, only one arrived. After numerous calls to both British Airways and American Airlines, I discovered the missing bag was still in London. Complaints were filed with both airlines (Complaint Numbers: [Insert Complaint Numbers]).

It has been over five days, and I still haven't received my bag. Every time I contacted British Airways customer service, I got vague responses and was blamed on American Airlines. On July 10, your customer service had the nerve to tell me not to call again because 'no one here can help you with this.' They claimed it was American Airlines' responsibility to contact British Airways and said there was no manager or email to escalate my issue.

This is completely unacceptable. My bag was last in your custody in London, making it your responsibility. Your dismissive and unhelpful attitude has only made things worse.

I demand immediate action to find and deliver my bag. I also expect compensation for the stress and inconvenience this has caused. I will never fly with British Airways again and will tell everyone I know to avoid your airline.

Even before flight day it took me 7-8 hours just to connect to one of the representatives to talk about assitance and online check in. They I  booked flight from Mumbai to Boston via London, my initial flight for delayed by 2 hours which cause me missing my connecting flight to Boston even though both flights were operated by British airways they didn't care about waiting for the passagenrs. It's not our mistake if previous flight got delayed they should I have handled it. And they didn't had the flight to boston for next 2 days,what BA thought we dont have any  any work to do, how are they going to compensate for this. I had to travel to New York then to boston.

Disgusting treatment of people with disabilities. Paid extra for upper deck seats to be on our own due to my partner having a disability causing him to get up and go to the toilet a lot on the flight. Got to the airport and got told due to ‘power issues’ we could not sit in our seats and have been moved to the main deck to window seat next to someone. We got told these are your seats and ask for a refund online. When we got to check in we went and spoke to a BA representative at the airport. He was speaking to people in front of us upgrading them to business class for no extra cost as he knew them. And also saying the ‘flight wasn’t even that full’. When we got to speak to the representative he said we can sit in our original seats with no power or he can book us middle row seats and block the middle seat. I said i did not understand that people on the upper deck are sitting alone blocking two seats and due to an issue that isn’t our fault we are being moved when we have paid for our seats like everyone else. He said he could not move other passengers as “they have paid”. I said we have also paid. We were told there is nothing they can do even though this representative was upgrading people and moving other passengers about as he pleased.

"My first experience of the double decker Airbus A380 and what a miserable time my family had. Firstly, the air conditioner motors at the back of the upper deck stopped working and secondly we sat on the plane at the gate before taxi-ing for take off for about 45 minutes. It felt like it was 30C in the cabin and tempers were also flaring. Excuses, excuses and then no explanation or apologies from the cockpit until we were almost landing. This plane is so large that I think it is limited to certain runways or slots. The meals were the worst that my family had ever eaten on a plane (dog food was used to describe it). On the return from LHR the food was better but the excuses for the delays again were galling. The captain admitted that the gates we could go to were limited at Logan and the taxi-ing time and waiting for other planes to get out of the way must have added a 40-50 minute delay to disembarkation.  Thinking we could finally get on our way, we waited another 40-50 minute delay for our suitcases. My feeling was that most of the return delays were caused by the large size of the A380 and the sheer number of passengers (nearly 500) needing to get on and off with the associated logistics of dealing with 500-600 pieces of luggage. My family vowed to never fly BA again and for me, I will avoid the A380 at all costs and choose single decker planes. Just another thought about LHR. Terminal 5 (BA's terminal) is a disaster. The check-in process is confusing and the BA counter agent was unhelpful and unfriendly. The escalators broke between the security floor and departure transit floor and all hell broke loose. There are two small elevators near the escalators and if you can imagine 100-150 people rushing and pushing to get to their flights in these, you can imagine the scene. Two guys ran down the up escalators, they were so desperate. People were screaming at the security staff. There is only one this one area for egress which was amazing.  Once on the lower floor, I was also disappointed at the paltry selection of dining options. Basically, Pret a Manger and Itsu or a proper sit down restaurant. I've already booked my next flight to London on Virgin Atlantic. I don't want to experience BA, the A380 or Term 5 for a long long time.

"If I bought a non-refundable BA flight at a good price 10 months prior to onboarding date. Then they cancelled it 1 month prior to the flight departure without a reason.

Due to short notice, I have to buy another flight for my holiday with a much more expensive price.

I made a complaint but BA said they cancelled the flight and informed me more than 14 days so they have no obligations to reimburse my loss.

The flight is non-refundable which means I am not able cancel it as I want. However, they can cancel it freely prior to 14 days.

The flight BA088 and BA089 was booked on 10-Jul-2023 with a departure date 29-Mar-2024 and return date 15-Apr-2024 so I can bring my kids to have an school Easter holiday.

There is only 1 flight to my destination per day.

The flight was booked through an online travel agency.

31-Aug-2023, the departure flight was cancelled. and I was given one option to fly on 30-Mar-2024, which made my holiday 1 day less. I accepted it as a bad luck.

27-Jan-2024, the return flight was cancelled. and I was offered a few options (I can't remember clearly). the nearest flight is either a few days before 15-Apr or a few days after 15-Apr-2024 (definitely not 1 or 2 days)

Due to the school will open soon, and I can't have a too short holiday. so I requested refund and bought another flight from another company which cost a lot of more money.

In my experience, BA attracted me with a very low price and I was very happy to book it 9 months prior to departure. But they suddenly cancelled 1+ months prior to my departure when there are no cheap prices.

They are playing with the regulations and play the customers. I understood that even they won't be punished by the law. But if they kept doing this to the customers. In my understanding, the company's aim is only not to break the law, which doesn't deserve respect and have very low morality.

BTW, I bought another flight for my sister in law which was supposed to fly here for a holiday. The departure date is 05Aug2024 and the flight was also cancelled 1+ months prior to departure and I was offered a flight departing on 07Aug2024. However, she has already asked for annual leave and could not change. I had to buy another flight for her which cost me additional 200+£.

Crew were the typical BA crew, stoic and friendly.  Overall, the flight was good, however, the flight was late getting into ATH so we were delayed taking off.  We also had air traffic delays too.

"I have never flown BA so was looking forward to it. We arrived from Vancouver at 12.45 hrs. Our connecting flight was 15.40. We arrived at the gate and the staff were not boarding passengers. They let families and challenged passengers through and did not deal with anyone else.
20 mins after the flight was due to leave it was cancelled. Nobody told us what was happening. 
Passengers were frustrated and angry as there was no communication. A couple of managers came, went and did not deal with or speak to any passengers. 
Eventually staff said we should receive an email to link us to what flight we had been rebooked onto. Several people, including ourselves were continually being told to sit and wait. 
We were treated appallingly. 
9 of us were left and were then shunted upstairs so the gate staff could go home. One of them commented ' this was inevitable as the plane is old and broken'.
Nobody upstairs knew what was going on and we had been told nothing either.
Information desk then told us we had been put on a flight in 24 hours time!!!! Do BA think we did not have work? My husband is self employed and had to cancel 3 appointments. We were then told to go to ' connections ' and ask for Kim. Well she appeared to make herself unavailable and told her colleague to tell us to go to baggage reclaim and the information desk and our cases and hotel vouchers would be waiting for us.

"I took my wife to Verona for a Valentine break.  This was a BA holiday  booking. On the flight out I bought some duty free Gin in Glass bottles, as a frequent flyer with BA, having previously held a gold card , I knew that Glass bottles had to go under the seat in front of me.  However the stewardess insisted they go into the locker above me.  The same stewardess insisted on rushing to get a gentleman's small Louis  Vuitton gift bags out of the same locker when we landed.  Doing so without due care and attention as she pulled the bottles out on my head!  Then denied knowing what had happened.  I suffered quite a lot of bruising (which I sent photos of to British Airways as they bounced off my head, shoulder side & legs) which also led to a massive headache, all of which was stated in a claim I sent into British Airways.  I also told them that I had a witness to the incident who had kindly given us their details to pass on if needed.  When stating my claim for compensation I told them this.  This was after all a health and safety issue. 

However, every time I contacted British Airways re the claim I was told it was still being reviewed.  Today as I've still had no response I looked up my claim to find it had been resolved!  I have had no contact whatsoever from British Airways except to be told it was under review!  I then  find they have closed it saying it has been fully resolved!  Without contacting me to say so or asking for the witness details. I'd like to know how they resolved it and what the outcome was especially as  I was obviously not a party to the resolution as I am still waiting to hear back from them. 

There were  also issues with my wife's assistance and meals on the way back, apparently according to British Airways this is 'still under Review' wonder when that will get resolved or will they resolve it without contacting us as well?  Or have they mixed the cases up as we had three ongoing cases with them, 2 of which show as resolved whereas in actual fact only one has been resolved. 

To say we are pretty disgusted with them is an understatement.

We were due to fly from city airport at 07.40. Unbelievably BA sent an email at 00.33am on the day of the flight to notify us the flight had been cancelled.

"Never intended to write this review until BA customer services showed they don't care.
What An appalling experience with British Airways and BA Holidays from start to finish. We booked a British Airways Holiday Business Class for 4 people to celebrate a 60th Birthday with friends who had never flown business class in their entire 60 years.
BA (Flight BA2702)  changed the plane to Titan and although we called them beforehand BA told us everything was unchanged. That was not true. There's no business class on Titan so everyone in economy got a result except those who had paid a premium as we did. Our seats were by the toilets at the front of the plane, so queues for toilets and in and out the entire flight. If only I could have charged a £1. Food was crap as it had congealed due to the unexplained 70 minute delayed take off. 
OK, we thought, at least it will be better on the return flight BA2703 
Oh no it wasnt!
They changed our return flight to Titan 2 days before we left and their email gave contact numbers, but when we called, they were closed for 2 days!
Same situation on the way back. Tried to get through to customer services for 10 days, got the standard 'we are busy....' So wrote a complaint to the CEO @ seanl.doyle@ba.com setting everything out, particularly that what we paid for is not what we got. Wrote far more than I can put in this review about how awful the flights were. He passed it on and we got a derisory offer to shut us up. Not even the refund for the privilege of flying economy where we paid for business. Is this how BA boosts its profits? Over charge and under deliver on what their customers pay for? Looks like we will have to fight this out so thats what we will do. Our only expectation was to get what we paid for, which wasn't cheap and done only to celebrate a 60th birthday.

"Arrived at Heathrow with plenty of time to spare, headed for business class check-in, where it has been for many tears,  only to find, with absolutely no notification from BA, that they have moved it to the almost the other end of the airport. Thankfully they really weren’t busy, so let us check in anyway, obviously no fast track through security as we were in the wrong place. From then on everything went well until we boarded. Flight delayed but time made up. We flew at 7am, so breakfast was served, at least that’s what BA call it. I have honestly never been given such a disgusting looking meal in my life, see photo, I had not touched it in any way, this is exactly how they served my gluten free meal to me, they should be ashamed. My husband’s breakfast was fine. 
Bused to terminal at Tenerife South airport, no surprises there, and straight through passport control.
Return flight, well over an hour late taking off. Flight 40 minutes arriving into TS, then what I can only describe as a complete farce, especially for those who were disabled. As usual disabled passengers and those with babies/small children boarded first, or at least they should have! There were at least half a dozen disabled people on our flight, they were wheeled onto the tarmac and then transferred into, what I can only describe as a container lorry, once the doors were closed they then had to be driven round to the opposite side of the plane to everyone else and then transferred onto the plane. However, having been loaded into the container, it then came to light that the lorry’s engine wouldn’t start. 
By now, as part of Group 1, we had been standing in the stair well, watching all of this through the large window, for at least 20 minutes. Meanwhile, directly ahead of us, also in the stairwell, were many parents carrying babies/small children. Eventually someone made the decision to get on and board the non-disabled passengers ahead of the disabled ones, who still had to be unloaded from the first container and moved to the one next door. Decision made we all start to walk out to the plane steps, clearly no one had told the staff on board that this decision had been made. Upon reaching the steps we came to a standstill. For the next 5 minutes with their babes/young children, the parents stood outside in blazing sunshine until they were allowed to board. Once everyone had boarded, the disabled passengers were eventually able to board as well.
Lunch was almost as bad as breakfast had been, my gluten free fish was so dry, and I don’t actually have words to describe it. We were in row 2, the same row and seats that we always have. Having been given the menu, my husband chose the roast beef. Upon being asked which of the 3 choices he would like, he was informed that they had run out of roast beef. The stewardess informed me that they only ever have 4 roast beefs and they had already been served. As such, not liking either of the other 2 choices, my husband chose the one that came with a Caesar Salad, see photo, which is not a Caesar salad.

"We love to travel, which is one of the reasons I signed up to be a travel agent on the side. We were fortunate enough to recently go on a dream vacation to Europe. We flew British Airways from PDX to London/Heathrow airport for our first and final flights. I’m just going to put this warning out there now- AVOID THIS AIRLINE AT ALL COSTS. While the direct flight from Portland to London may seem amazing and the crew on the aircraft was lovely, the experience outside these two perks was an absolute nightmare.
Our first problem started right after booking our flights. When you create an account and link your booking via your British Airways confirmation, a majority of the time, you receive an error when you go to “my bookings” that it cannot be displayed. The app is even worse. It’s next to impossible to check-in for a flight via the app. The screen just thinks/spins forever, and then when you finally do check in via the mobile website page instead, it’s hit or miss whether or not the system recognizes that you checked in. 
Next major issue- We paid $560 ($70 a bag each way) to check our luggage. British airways emails you a receipt with no receipt number. When you get to the check-in counter to drop off your bags, no one can see that you prepaid for your checked luggage. On our return flight (Rome to London, then London to Portland), we stood at the counter for 30 minutes wondering if we would even make it to our flight on time (after waiting nearly an hour in line just to get to the counter) while the employee fumbled on her computer and searched my email receipt for a number because she claims she could not waive our luggage fees without a receipt number. BRITISH AIRWAYS EMAILED ME THIS RECEIPT. THIS IS YOUR AIRLINE’S RECEIPT. Somehow she figured it out at the last minute and we made it on the plane (so did our luggage. Until our connecting flight….
We arrive at London Heathrow for our layover on 6/30. As we were sitting down for a nice lunch to celebrate my husband’s birthday, I get an app notification that my luggage was ready to be collected at baggage claim. I have Tile GPS trackers in our luggage and noticed that my suitcase was separated from all of the others. So I go down to the British Airways desk, tell the employee about my app notification, show her that my suitcase is down at baggage claim on my Tile app and she tells me to ignore it and that my luggage will be on the plane. She would not call down to baggage claim to confirm that my suitcase was not there. Spoiler alert- It was down at baggage claim. After a 10 hour flight home, we arrive at PDX to find that my bag was left behind, as suspected. The employee at PDX has me fill out a paper form, give me no case information and says they will call me. Guess what! I did not get a call. Not only that, but no one submitted a case in the system. So anytime I called for help or tried using the chat option, no one knew what was going on with my missing property. As I watch my luggage going down the London motorway on day 2 of being missing (7/1), I spend 2 hours on a chat with this poor employee who was running into the same errors as I was with British Airways useless website, and neither of us can submit a missing baggage case online or request my baggage fee to be refunded after this mess.
Day 3 (7/2)- I finally get a case submitted and receive a notification that my luggage has boarded a flight to PDX. Finally, we’re getting somewhere. The courier company that picked up my luggage at PDX was great, and the communication on their website worked well once it left the hands of British Airways. Now I had the task of simply requesting a refund for 1 of the 8 baggage fees from British Airways as the employee at PDX advised. I had to submit another case on their website for this, and wait days for an email response. The email reply was almost comical. They told me I had to email my FULL BANK ACCOUNT INFORMATION to them (account number, routing number, bank name and branch). Forget the fact that I paid with a credit card not associated with my bank account and apparently it’s not possible to simply reverse 1 of the 8 separate charges. But what company has you email your bank account information on an un-secured email? I noticed afterwards that there is a disclaimer saying not to send full credit card information (this is highlighted on my attached screen shot). Thankfully I have another account with no real money that I could give them, and just move the refund myself. Ready for the kicker? I receive an email back from British Airways saying they will transfer $10 to my account. The baggage fee is $70. I didn’t even know how to respond to that. If I see a $10 refund after this entire experience in my account, I’ll likely just dispute the charge with my credit card company as the customer service at British Airways is an absolute joke.
Attached to this post are screen shots of chats, emails, my luggage sitting where I told the employees it was sitting. This review is going everywhere I can possibly post online to encourage anyone traveling anywhere to steer clear of this company.

Just make sure to use reputable companies that don’t spoil your experience. 😊

"Returning from Corfu on a BA flight but was changed to Danish Air both ways. Flying business class, was very poor.  Menu enclosed which looks very nice but found only one option of main course available the Cod.  For anyone who had not pre-booked a vegetarian option a meal was not available, I was told that other people had taken the other meals.  
No hot towel to freshen up, no roll with meal, no wine offered to accompany meal.  I have attached a photo of the starter supposedly a Vegetarian Caesar salad, roasted broccoli,  this consisted of a congealed Luke warm sauce, quarter of a tomato, a quarter hard boiled egg and a leaf of some description plus Broccoli.  Could not eat this. Whoever thought this was  Caesar salad was no chef.  It seemed hardly anyone ate the meal, the trays were returned mostly untouched. The cabin crew did not use a meal trolly so were dashing back and forward to the galley to collect meal trays. The interior was old, unclean, definitely not a Business Class experience.  Outbound flight to Corfu was far better, great cabin crew, meal was good, so the return trip experience made it all the more disappointing.

"Avoid this airline if possible. We flew British Airways only because it is one of the few that fly non-stop from New Orleans to London, and then connect to Edinburgh, Scotland. However, we suffered a 5 hr. delay leaving New Orleans due to some alleged electrical problem. We then missed our connecting flight to Scotland. To BA's credit, they did promptly book us on another connecting flight to Edinburgh departing not long after our delayed arrival at Heathrow. However, our new flight to Edinburgh was then delayed another 2 1/2 hrs due to another mechanical issue requiring a new plane after we had already boarded the originally scheduled flight.  To add insult to injury, the quality of food and drink on board left much to be desired. Given all of these delays, one would think that BA might at least offer something free to ease the pain, but no, only verbal apologies.",2.0,New Orleans,Edinburgh,International,June 2024,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0

"I usually fly Easyjet but decided to 'treat' myself so upgraded to British Airways having not flown with them for years. Probably the worst decision I've ever made.
I preordered food and drink for my flight out and they had no notification and couldn't forfill my order. 
Flying back the cabin crew were not very professional and one kept saying British Airways aren't what they used to be, he got that right for sure but it's not something he should be saying to passengers imho.
I arrived back to Gatwick and after waiting 1/2 hour for bags to arrive on the carasel 2 BA employees appeared but did not make any announcements. We had to approach them to ask where the luggage was. We were told they had left 64 cases behind in Lanzarote due to weight restrictions!! Unbelievable. We then had to queue to pick up claim and customs forms and leave case less. Then the fun really began. I received an email quickly with a reference number for my missing suitcase but I was then fobbed off with conflicting information as to where my case was. All of my summer clothes were in my case and I arrived home when we were having lovely hot weather. My case was on one flight according to an email I received, and confirmed when I phoned but then I received another email with different flight details. 
My suitcase finally arrived at my door 7 days after I had landed at Gatwick. I had had an amazing holiday but it was ruined by British Airways as I was so stressed for the whole week afterwards not knowing whether I would ever see all of my possessions ever again.
I expected so much more from British Airways and the only difference from flying Easyjet was a little bit extra leg room.

"the worst experience i have ever had, my brother and i flew from copenhagen to heathrow and on to JFK new york from there and the planes they use for flights in europe have no leg room at all i have added with sky express before which is a cheap company and they had more legroom and better service, and the flight between heathrow and JFK it was a very old and worn cabin where our screens in the seat didn't work, the seat cushions were loose and the item you ordered is not ready on the seat as promised, the only good thing who was on the trip to JFK was a Steward who was incredibly helpful and willing to talk to, and the new upgraded cabin on their 777-300 has much worse comfort in the seats than the old cabin, the screens reacted very slowly and the cabin staff were generally extremely bad and seemed indifferent to the economy class passengers as well as acting like they were better than us passengers, my brother's suitcase was thrown away at heathrow on the way to the US and was told to just buy what he needed and be fine and then BA should probably cover it but hear nothing about the inquiry he has sent to them, all 4 flights were delayed but the one from heathrow to Copenhagen ended up being 2 hours late due to a technical fault in another flight so they chose to use our for that departure and had to wait for a plane that was flown in from Amterdam, even though they had at least 2 of those planes at some gates that were not used anyway and when we are finally in the air, the cabin staff say over the loudspeakers that they are sorry for the delay and as excuse, buisness class gets free afternoon tea and they just had to say if there is anything else they would like, then again they didn't care about us ordinary people in economy class.

"We were unable to check in online,  found out once we had arrived at the airport - 3 hours before departure - the flight was overbooked and we ‘may’ be able to get on the flight. At the time of boarding we had to wait to see if there was any seats left to then be told that we wouldn’t be able to board the flight !!! We had booked an all inclusive holiday so unsure why they thought we wouldn’t show up . It caused a lot of unneeded stress and anxiety at the start of our holiday. Luckily we were able to get on the next flight - otherwise we would of had to wait 12 hours to fly to Athens and from there to Crete !

My main issue was that the staff treated it like it was something we should have expected .. like it is normal to NOT get a seat on a plane which we had booked and paid for .

So what do you pay the extra for ?! Drinks and food, which wasn’t anything special. I suggest that BA either take a row or two of seats out to give more space or not offer business class on European flights.

"I have flown with British Airways twice this year, once to Dubai and once to Bodrum, and both experiences were incredibly disappointing.

On the flight from Dubai, the in-flight entertainment system in my entire section wasn't working. We had to sit through an 8-hour flight with no TV, which was extremely frustrating. To make matters worse, by the time the food service reached us, most of the options were gone, leaving us with whatever was left. The air hostesses were extremely unhelpful and showed no concern for our discomfort.

The flight from Bodrum was even worse. The entire plane didn't have water. We had to use bottled water to wash our hands after using the bathroom, and they couldn't serve any hot drinks due to the lack of water. British Airways seems to be trying to maximize profits by cramming as many rows of seats as possible, leaving no legroom. I am 5'1' and could barely fit in my seat, so I can't imagine how anyone taller could manage.

Overall, these experiences have left me extremely dissatisfied with British Airways. The lack of basic amenities and poor customer service are unacceptable, and I will be reconsidering my airline choices in the future.",1.0,Bodrum District,London,Europe,July 2024,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0

"The main issue was that my seat had been urinated on by a previous passenger.

I boarded the flight in the final group so quickly stowed my bag, picked up the blanket and pillow from my seat and sat down. I noticed after takeoff that my jeans had become damp, but couldn't get up until the seatbelt sign had been switched off about 30 minutes in. That's when I saw the damp stain on my seat (pictured). I checked my jeans and the chair, both of which now smelled of urine. I raised this with the flight crew who suggested I cover the stain with a blanket and take another available seat. One apologised. No further action was taken regarding this on the flight and I sat for 11 hours, uncomfortable and concerned I smelled of urine anytime I got up. I subsequently developed a rash from the moisture. I was unable to change as all of my clothes were in my checked luggage. No reassurance was given that the seat would be cleaned before the next flight, nor was it explained as to why this hadn't been noticed when the aircraft was prepared for the current flight. It is unhygienic, uncomfortable, and unacceptable.

I subsequently raised a complaint regarding the issue and, after 9 days, received little more than generic responses that my concerns had been passed on to the relevant teams, and offering a £50 voucher towards another BA flight or holiday. Ironic, as after this experience I'm very unlikely to travel with BA again.

Additionally, the customer service experience is incredibly frustrating, inefficient, and ineffective. On multiple occasions the people dealing with my complaint failed to address more than one issue at a time, resulting in wasted time asking them to address the other issues (such as refunding the paid for seat on my original flight from LHR - LAS, which I missed due to a delayed connecting flight from Glasgow, before being rebooked onto the flight from Gatwick to Las Vegas without being afforded the opportunity to choose a seat > i.e. a service paid for which I didn't receive).

This experience proves that BA don't care about your comfort or experience, and I have had much better experiences with issues on budget airlines, such as easyjet. Spend your money and your time elsewhere.

Not too mention this situation could have been avoided or improved at several points.
1) the urine could have been noticed when the aircraft was prepared for the flight from Gatwick to Las Vegas
2) the crew on the aircraft could have given a comprehensive response to the incident
3) the customer service team could have given a thorough response to the complaint

"I booked a flight on EI8311 ( operated by British Airways BA1421) In January 2024 for an upcoming holiday.  the purpose of this flight was to make a connection with a Long Haul flight from Heathrow to Auckland New Zealand. When I checked in to this flight at George Best  Belfast city Airport on thursday 27th June 2024, I was told that this flight is over booked, and that i would be placed on stand by, There was still no room on this flight for me. I was told by a Very Rude Male Representitive, that i would have to make other arrangements to get to Heathrow. I rang my Travel agent in New Zealand who wanted to speak to the Check in person who had denied my boarding to try and find a solution, the check in man was very uncooperative and rude and refused to help. I rang British Airways, who told me to ring Aer Lingus because that was who i had paid through. When I Called Aer Lingus they told Me that British Airways were operating the flight on their behalf, and that it was British Airways that had stuffed me around, Call them Back and get them to Organise a flight with them. So i did. I was then put onto flight BA8757 to London city Airport, Meaning i still had to find my way to Heathrow. This flight was to depart George Best Belfast at 1650 and arrive At  London City at 1820. My Cjeck in at Heathrow was due to open 7pm and close at 9pm. BA8757 was delayed by 1 hour 10 minutes due to a fallen Curtain rail of all things. As a result of this delay, I got to Heathrow Terminal 2 Check in at 9.15pm and missed my check in by 5 minutes (check in had remained open 10 minutes later than normal for any late comers). The check in staff for Air China CA856 would not accomodate for my delays and therefore I missed my light home to New Zealand. Distresed, i camped out in the  Terminal, and in the morning sought about trying to find a flight home.   I got passed from Pillar to post, sent from 1 side of Heathrow to another and back again multiple times!! what does a solo Dad have to do to get home to his Kids who were very upset to learn that Dad had missed his flight. British Airways, who were responsible for the delays, and stuffing me around in the first place, Still weren't helpful and were very arrogant and outrightly refused to help. .. i felt isolated, stuck on the other side of the world from my kids and with no one within BA willing to help. My Family in New Zealand came to my rescue, and they booked me on An Emirates flight out of Heathrow that evening. I would not be recomending BA to anyone.  I felt let down, appauled and distresed at the poor Customer service I recieved. I have a very large extended family, and none of us will every fly with British Airways ever again.

"This was actually a British Airways/American Airlines code share, but I did the same route a month earlier on the British Airways operated flight.  First of all, BA has its faults, and many at that, but the AA flight wins the prize of plumbing the bottom of the airline swamp. Surly staff barking orders, and food that would not be accepted in an animal shelter.  Staff who pay zero attention to the selfish folks who recline their seats while drink and food are being served rendering the 6 inches for the passenger behind unuseable, and staff who race to complete their tasks so they can retreat to their bunk bed sleeping quarters for the night. But this is just the beginning if you have an onward BA connection. The majority of BA flights leave from Terminal 5 in London Heathrow. However a handful of 'red haired step children destinations' end up in Terminal 3. Phoenix (and many African nations) end up in Terminal 3, as do AA flights.  So, if you are in transit to connect with your BA flight to Italy, Spain etc. you have to walk the complete length of Terminal 3 (feels like half a mile plus after being up all night), go downstairs, catch an undersized and overcrowded bus, drive for a mile or so to Terminal 5, work your way all the up to the top floor, and line up with hundreds of other passengers desperately trying to get through security (again), all the while the clock is ticking ever closer to your onward gate being shut. It's a goat rodeo. BA, you charge top dollar, you take our money, and then you treat us like second class citizens, forcing us to participate in a wannabe Iron Man race to make our connecting flight, a flight we have paid top dollar for, all the while you smile all the way to the bank.",1.0,Phoenix,London,International,June 2024,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0

"@british_airways ruined what was a happy day yesterday (30th June) when arriving at the airport to check in for our flight to Cape Town.  This pantomime of an airline decided to put us on standby  because of their greed to overbook seats in the hope passengers would not turn up for their flights. Totally and utterly ruined our excitement to get away for our honeymoon after getting married on Saturday. 
Arrived in London ( in the hope we might still get on the flight) to join a queue at customer services (couldn’t go any further than the arrivals corridor) waited ages as it was shambolic and eventually got told the flight was full and the seats we paid for months ago had been sold to someone else.  So after about 3 hrs we got handed some vouchers for food and a shuttle bus (that’s another story as there was no bus at that time in the morning!) Booked us into a hotel (PI are better organised than BA) but had to pay for a taxi to get us there.  By 01:30 this morning we eventually got to our room with no luggage or toiletries so no clean clothes and will have to go shopping for some! Awoke early knowing I would have to notify my TA of BA’s terrible service and to reorgnise transport, notify our hotel of our no show….contact our trip organiser because we are now missing an all day tour which is non refundable!!!  

So we’re booked on the 10:25 tonight (01st of July) I’m hoping we get on our flight and that our seats are not resold again!!! I can’t even rebook the special food I had ordered on the previous flight as the system won’t let me, better make sure I’ve got food in my hand luggage.

"Absolutely awful experience from start to (I'm still waiting for it to) finish.

I had to fly back from Dubai with all of my possessions after my job fell through.

Put on a seat at the back of the plane by the window. I checked in when I was told to, on the minute, but it then turned out I could have paid an extra £35 to book a seat I wanted to before this time. So I then spent a 7 hour flight cramped and uncomfortable.

The screen for entertainment was tiny and there were no headphones provided to watch it...who on earth's idea was that? The port for the headphones were for an old iphone, which I happen to have but as far as I could see, nobody else did.

The food was absolutely disgusting and poor quality. You'd get better at a lower division football team than the pie I got for a snack, which was barely cooked and had the consistency of wet sawdust.

At some point in the flight, one of the attendants came up to me to let me know I had been a member of BA's Executive Club for 10 years...and nothing. I wasn't offered even a cup of tea let alone maybe an upgrade beforehand for 10 years' of service. 

No, it was pretty much 'thank you and f*ck you' while I was sat on the worst seat on the plane.

Getting to the other end I then discovered that my luggage had been lost due to a baggage system breakdown I am absolutely certain was in part BA's fault. 

It's now four days later and I have one of my bags back but not the main one containing almost all of my possessions.

The customer service line cut me off after informing me that they 'had been receiving a lot of enquiries'...it didn't even place me on hold.

I am still waiting for my luggage.

The utter contempt and disrespect of BA towards its customers is disgusting. I will NEVER fly BA again and I urge everyone everywhere never to fly with them. Let them fall apart as an example of how high-paying customers should not be so disrespected.

They do not care about you, will take your money, lose your possessions and then throw you off the plane with a jolly 'f*ck you' and goodbye. Then when you want to get your things back they let you know that actually you're not important to them and ignore your enquiries.

"Well, to start with, ground team at the counter ( TIA Tirana Albania airport) was unpolite and helpless. As a Oneworld member Platinum status, they didn’t know I had my checked luggage for free. They wanted to charge me. As always my bags go with Priority tags on, which they never attached one while checked my luggages.
Ground agent had no clue to respond me why I was giving only one boarding pass instead of having all my three connections boarding passes.
On Board:
You make sure you have your phone or your tablet fully charged before you take a British operated flight, since none of USB porter or jack is in working condition. Took already few british flights and also on A380 aircraft, and had to deal with this issue. Seems like no one cares about ports and screens . None of the screens worked and none of the jacks or USB ports worked. So imagen flying 9 hours and then the connection aircraft still with the same issue where you CANNOT charge your phone?

"We started an 8-day trip from Phoenix to Geneva—the first flight from Phoenix to Houston was through American Airlines. Next, the British Airways flight from Houston to London was canceled when I arrived in Houston. No one from BA was there to say anything. I got an email that I am now scheduled for a next-day flight: no luggage, no hotel, nothing. No one from the airlines was at the gate or at the British Airways counter. I had to get security to locate an employee who was not helpful. He sent us to United without anything. United sent us back to BA. When they finally booked the flight, they made the connecting flight from Heathrow Airport to Geneva very tight while we needed to go to a different terminal and re-check through security, so we missed that flight too. Now we are stranded in the airport for 10 hours and lost two full days of the 8-day trip. No one bothered to apologize. Most of the counter employees were rude and minimally helpful. 
On the way back from CDG to PHX, they delayed my luggage. Today is day #10 without the luggage being delivered. I called every day and unsuccessfully offered to pick it up from the airport. Every time I call, I get the same answer: It will be delivered to your address.

Of course , as with every time this same thing has happened, the overhead storage had plenty of space.
This is terrible service and is only causing more pain to the customer.

If BA has issues with overhead space, the first reasonable action is for the flight attendants to ensure that only eligible items are placed there (handluggages vs jackets and personnal items) and that storage is used efficiently.

"Worst service ever received on a BA flight. We upgraded 3 adult fares at a cost of £359 per person for World Traveller Plus. The seats are more spacious so more comfortable on a long flight. However, the food service was utterly appalling. Apparently, there was a medical event which took all the crew out of service for a few hours. This meant that we were left with no crew in our cabin. We were served drinks but we didn't get the usual snacks. Then we were served food. We were told that there was no Teriyaki Chicken left so we could have the Ham Hock pie or the aubergine vegetarian option. None of us like aubergine and on my last flight to Tokyo in April 2024, the pie was also an option but the passenger seated next to me said it was inedible and even the cabin crew said to avoid it because they'd had so many complaints. We were told that the only other option was to accept a Teriyaki chicken meal from the World Traveller cabin which is a smaller portion size. We took this option because otherwise we would not have eaten on a 14 hour flight. Furthermore, it took the crew 2 hours to clear the trays and we were not offered any tea or coffee as is the usual standard procedure.

"My recent experience with British Airways was an absolute nightmare, and I feel compelled to share the details to warn other travelers. From start to finish, the service was appalling and completely unacceptable.

Firstly, upon arriving at our destination, we discovered that our luggage was missing. We weren't alone in this frustration—more than 200 passengers were frantically searching for their bags. The chaos was exacerbated by the unhelpful and rude staff at the baggage claim counters. Instead of assisting us, they seemed irritated by our questions and concerns, offering no solutions or even basic courtesy.

The in-flight experience was no better. When I politely asked a flight attendant for a glass of water, I was met with a shockingly rude response. The attendant called us 'stupid Americans,' a deeply offensive and unprofessional comment. It’s astonishing that British Airways employs individuals who think it’s acceptable to belittle their passengers in such a manner. To add to the insult, these attendants seemed oblivious to the fact that many of their passengers, myself included, hold prestigious and demanding jobs. Such disrespect towards paying customers is inexcusable.

Overall, this experience with British Airways was profoundly disappointing. From the mishandling of luggage to the outright disrespect from flight attendants, every aspect of this journey was marred by poor service and a lack of basic human decency.

"I flew British Airways as a child in the 1980s until now and only when I have no choice to fly it.  I am willing to pay more to avoid British Airways and London Heathrow airport.   Since the 1980s British Airways shows a total disregard for Muslims, Jews, vegetarians Jains and Hindus by having the main meat be pork with no vegetarian option.  When they offer  a vegetarian option, they offer too little and the airplane runs out.  Within the past 10 years or longer, you can order a special meal. If you don't order a special meal you are in trouble.  My flight from London to New Delhi offered a breakfast choice of bacon sandwich (Muslims, Jews, vegetarians Jains and Hindus cannot eat it) vs egg and cheese (disgusting).   You would think with an Prime Minister and 3 time London mayor both of Indian origin BA would  be more sensitive with meals but no since the 1980s until today their breakfast is bacon.  I ordered a special meal months ago and verified it 3 days before the flight and did not load it on the plane.  They also ran out of vegetarian food flying out of New Delhi in India which is probably the most vegetarian country on earth.  In their defense they offered me rejected food from first class but it was a very crocodile tears / stiff upper lip action.   Most airlines print the list of special meals and before the flight ask each consumer who ordered a special meal to verify but BA does not do this.  

Another thing is British Airways in the past lost our bags but lately this did not happen so there is improvement.

British Airways is an embarrassment to Great Britain.  I don't understand how the nation that ushered the world into modernity with the Industrial Revolution can have an airline remain consistently bad from the 1980s until today.

The lady behind me purchased the kiddies box, the description being snacks, a toy, puzzles and crayons. When she received it there were no crayons and when complained, the cabin crew member simply said '' I'm not sure what you want me to do about it'. She paid £9 and the toy was an inch piece of rubber.

"We connected from a Qatar Airlines flight from Singapore onto the British Airways operated BA122 on the 2nd of May. BA gets quite a hard time lately and hence we were not expecting too much. 

I must say however we were very pleasantly surprised. The new BA Club Suite is a fantastic product, very comfortable and having a largish footwell made for a very comfortable sleep, I slept most of the 7 hours to London. 

The food out of Doha (breakfast) I thought was on the ordinary side - I wouldn't recommend the beef bacon, however the service was marvellous, the crew members looking after us I think were one of the more 'senior' crew, Marco and Louise and very pleasant and quite a laugh, this is a nice change from the efficient but slightly cold crew on Qatar. 

The wine list could be better, the reds, whites and champagne were pretty standard, although I did enjoy very much the English Sparkling wine - always good to be able to try some home grown product on a carrier.

"Mistake made when booking from Springfield Illinois instead of Springfield, MO. British Airways confirmation and itinerary says only Springfield and did list the airport code or  state so there was no way of knowing it was the wrong Springfield until 3 days before trip. Met with gaslighting and emotionally empty customer reps. Spoke to about 20 different customer reps to be met with the only option (other than $1000 change fee) to remove Springfield completely from itinerary and get myself to and from
Chicago on my own. They promised me they took care of this and all was good to go. New itinerary looked good.! I still called a few more times to double check that the wrong Springfield was indeed removed and my luggage would arrive in Chicago for me to pick up. 
On my return flight from Istanbul back to Chicago I could not access online booking. I went to counter to get boarding pass and the British Airways reps told me I had no ticket. I’m bright to tears and waited over an hour while they intimated and scared me into thinking I had no ticket because never showed up to Springfield, Illinois. Finally somehow they gave me a paper boarding pass. 

British Airways gives paper boarding passes that have no terminal info on them. Why? This caused me to almost miss my connection in Heathrow that changed to American Airlines yet they failed to inform me of this.

Now as a result of this nonsense and lack of care I’m stuck sr Ohare for 8 hours.

This is a terrible business class seat that I would never book and a refund should be in order, it’s called bait and switch. 

Then the plane circled Heathrow and went back to a stand to sit for over an hour, making the flight delayed by over 2 hours.

However just before midnight the night before our day of flying home, we received an email advising our flight was cancelled,  no reason given.
We called customer service and were connected to someone who was clearly abroad.  She wasn't at all interested in our predicament as the only flight we were offered as an alternative was to Heathrow not Gatwick where we had originally flown from. No offer of how to get from Heathrow to Gatwick.  The flight was for 6.45am the day after we should have flown home from Tenerife to Madrid.  Five hours to wait and then flight to Heathrow.

"Our flight out (BA0061 06.06.24) was our first experience with BA and with business class, it was a fantastic experience made all the more special by our flight attendant Holly and the rest of the team, exceptionally organised and personable service, food was fantastic and what we dreaded would be a very draining flight turned out to be very enjoyable and positive experience. On this experience alone i would not hesitate to recommend BA to friends and family, Thank you Holly for you infectious enthusiasm for providing a fantastic service, you are truly an asset to BA! On just this exerience we would have rated it 5 out of 5......however the return flight was the complete opposite, we booked very early and paid in full with the extra select your seat option for the return flight BA0060 from Male to Heathrow on 21.06.24. We checked in the night before our flight home on the app and noticed our seats had been changed, without any notice. When checking at the airport what the reason for this was, we were told that there were problems with those seats and no-one could sit there. Ok we thought, still annoyed that we had paid so much extra for seats we couldn't sit in but accepting a technical issue, but when we boarded we noticed people sitting in those seats....seriously annoyed at the misinformation! Not only had we been moved out of those seats, but we were moved out of the smaller front business class cabin to the very back of the larger business class cabin... this meant that when we came to choosing food we were always last to be asked and therefore had numerous issues with our choices not being available (so tip for any of you booking in to business class, book as close to the front of the cabin as possible). On top of this we seemed to be lacking the service that the other side of the cabin was receiving, I am not sure if our flight crew was short staffed on the flight but we had nowhere near the level of attentiveness shown to us as our outgoing flight, it was hugely disappointing to finish off our holiday in this fashion. We are also pretty sure we had a trainee pilot, everyone has to learn and we get that, but the communication between the captain and the crew seemed very hit and miss, the cabin crew looked like they were in a flat spin trying to get the cabins prepared for landing as they hadn't been given much of a heads up, rubbish was scattered throughout the cabin and several dividing screens were left up during landing, which was also daunting as it was pretty jolting. All of this added to the problems with the seats and general poor service on this flight, couldn't have been more different from our flight out. Just rating on this flight experience we would have rated 2 out of 5 (given 2 for the comfy seats and the attendant from the other side of our cabin who seemed to be doing the job of our attendant as well) BA you need to work on the consistency of service, especially when people are paying extra for business class and select your seats at huge extra cost....Will definitely make me think twice about booking with BA again.",3.0,London,Male,International,June 2024,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,3.0

I don’t believe any of our  BA flights have departed on-time this year. ‘“Just so you are aware the gate closes 20 minutes before departure” . This may be true but what they don’t add is that the gate is unlikely to open until 10 minutes before scheduled departure. EVERY time they robotically tell us we will HAVE to check-in our hand luggage because it is a ‘very  busy flight’. Surprise!  the number of people who booked on the flight have turned up. The staff expend not even a modicum of effort to police the volume of hand luggage. Lots of passengers with a trolley bag also had a ‘handbag’ the size of a sports hold-all or a rucksack fit for an artic expedition.

They confirmed me but in their system, the first booking remained and it appeared that I got two bookings. They have not refunded me so far, and I am not sure if I could ever get my money back. 
Secondly, when I checked in at the airport, the time was as planned. But soon afterwards it was delayed for almost 2 hours. I could not react and do anything.

"First BA flight in a while and I was shocked. 
 A320 refit was a joke.  Lack of legroom was a  real issue.  Only 5'11' but had to sit spread legged if did not want legs to be pressing into the seat in front.  Seats also very narrow.  The refit apparently took out one of the rear toilets and a closet for air crew.  As a result last 2 rows have no windows  and no overhead storage as after losing storage cupboard, aircrew have taken overhead storage lockers for their gear.  To get into the rear toilet staff has to sit sideways or stand and move out of way or could not open the doors to get in.  2 aircrew having to work in what was a closet really and good luck if they had a medical emergency on board as no room for any CPR for sure.  Glad no food service as seat tray only able to be brought down to say 30 degree slope due to lack of room.  Not a slim Jim but not a huge guy.  Never had any issue with Easyjet, Ryanair or Jet 2 so for short haul flights I would chose one of them.  So disappointed with our National carrier in what seems to simply be a money grab by packing in more seats just to make more profit. These comments are directed at BA management as flight crew themselves were great but I sure felt for them in the appalling conditions they had to work in.   One day maybe a carrier will take the economy class customer seriously by taking about 6 rows out, providing a bit more legroom for everyone, make the seats comfy enough to sit in and therefore make people chose them over all others.

"BA mis-sold me Business Class tickets for Economy Class. 

The on-line purchase process offered two options, one economy and the other business. I chose business and bought the tickets.
The outgoing flight “business class section” seat had no different leg room from economy. The seat was so close to the seat in front I could not open my computer properly and there was no entertainment, internet or recharging place for electric plugs.

All the people in the business class section swore they would never fly BA gain for mis-selling.

My return flight was even worse.

I flew from Manchester on a BA flight that was delayed. This was no fault of BA because it was due to bad weather. 
However, when I landed at Heathrow I was not allowed to transfer to the departure and business lounge. I was told that because my flight from Manchester to Heathrow was on the evening of the 26th May and my departure was at 6.40 am on the next morning, 27.5.2024, I could not transfer to the departure lounge. 
I was told to exit the terminal and come back the next morning. This was never flagged when I made my booking. All four flights are under one booking not separate bookings. So, I had to wait for 6 hours in the entrance of the airport until I can go through to the departure lounge.
I have never experienced this at other international airports.  
So why was this NOT flagged at the time of purchase so I could consider my options?
Then when Terminal 5 starts to open around 4.30 am, the business lounge only opens at 5.30 so as my flight was scheduled for 6.40 am I was hardly able to make use of it to at least have a drink and something to eat. 
I kept on checking the BA app on my phone and the notice board. Nothing! I went to check with one of the staff at the entrance to the South Lounge and she told me the gate number. The gate was only advised 35 minutes before the flight so it was a mad rush to get to the gate.

And again, the same economy flight standard home. There was absolutely no difference between the business section and economy. They were exactly the same seats. Indeed there is simply nothing to distinguish between business class and economy. I refer to this because BA in its arrogance, does not even try to differentiate between the two sections because there is no difference. 

The breakfast was absolutely disgusting and inedible. 

I have been sold an economy flight at a business flight price. That is the equivalent of +/- £600 extra for some poor food and drink plus being left stranded until the I could go through to the departure lounge.

If I would have known there is no difference between the two, I would have simply booked an economy flight.
BA treats us with contempt by selling tickets at business class prices but which are actually economy class conditions.

All BA does is apologise which are not only meaningless, they are worthless.

"Review LHR to Singapore and return

Check in at Heathrow Terminal 5 was brilliant apart from being asked if we were actually ‘flying club world’ Didn’t think we looked that scruffy!!

The Club lounge was very nice with a great view of the runway. Nice selection of light food and drinks.

Flight Dreamliner

Cabin on this plane takes 24 people and the space is good. A bit fiddly to find out how everything works. I needed the pillow to be comfortable in the seat
All the controls seemed a bit awkward. 
On boarding we were offered juice or fizz. 
After takeoff we had a drinks order followed by dinner which was quite nice.
I managed about 4 hours sleep as I am not great sleeping on airplanes. 
Many lucky people seemed to sleep through.

I felt slightly thrown by the darkened windows. I knew it should be light but until the airline decided it was morning I couldn’t get any light.
They didn’t make it morning until 8.30am uk time so 13.30 pm at our destination.
There is a low down drawer for your belongings but I would have liked a little pouch at arm hight to put things. I lost my kindle and it was too dark to find it. 

Don’t think either of us was as comfortable as hoped but maybe we are unusual.

Return leg.

BA lounge at Singapore Changi airport was very nice, good tasty food.

Wow what a huge plane. Always wanted to fly in one and it didn’t disappoint. Maybe we were just lucky but it was so smooth. 
I understand these planes are expensive to run and maintain but they are lovely. 

Generally I didn’t feel the service was as good as on the way out. One or two customers were obviously well known to the crew and definitely got preferential treatment.

Annoyingly although our bags were marked  as priority we waited ages for them to arrive. Over 30 minutes after the first bag arrived on the carousel.

After a wait of 40 minutes we were told we would have to go to Heathrow and fly via Palma. This turned a 6 hour door-to-door trip into a 17 hour trip. Again, no one was there to apologise and BA does not even have a general enquiries desk. We arrived in Ibiza only to find our suitcase was not on the plane. It arrived 36 hours later. This took out 1/3rd of our holiday and we are now having to spend time filling in forms to get an inadequate refund.

"I've had my share of flights throughout the United States and I know a good experience vs a bad one. I flew international for the first time ever and since I was going to Scotland I chose BA. My first flight out of the US was with AA so my experience with AA was as I had always expected. The rest of my flights were BA. I was hoping since it is one of the biggest airlines in UK I would be in good hands. I had issues with all three flights. The airline itself is very unorganized. Lets just say my experience navigating through Heathrow international transfer/security was smoother then my flights.
For my first flight it was from Heathrow to Edinburgh. I had a 4 hour layover to ensure I had adequate time to go through immigration at Heathrow. It took me less then 30 mins to do so. My flight gate wasn't available to me until 30 mins before my scheduled flight which I don't blame the airline more so to airport. My issue was my flight was delayed so I was waiting an extra hour for my flight. Since I didn't get my flight until 30 mins before my flight I was racing down the other side of the terminal to get to my gate which was 2a. To get to 2a though you had to go through 2b. Both gate barely had a waiting area so everyone was standing around. Passengers waiting to board 2b were were blocking the way to get through to 2a. A gate agent at 2b had announced that all passengers going to Paris must check their carryon and since Edinburgh passengers couldn't get through she assumed all passengers were Paris. I did not pay much attention to her as I was not a Paris passenger. I'm not sure if she assumed I did not understand English but she took it upon herself to grab my carryon suitcase stating I needed to check it in. I told her I am not flying to Paris and showed her my ticket. only then did she realize half the passengers in the crowd were Edinburgh passengers. She pushed my bag back and did not even apologize. Even with the delay the boarding still took forever to board this was due to the fact the gate 2 was not a gate boarding directly from a jet bridge to the plane. We had to take the bus from the gate which took us around the terminal to board on tarmac between two terminals.
My first flight back home from Edinburgh a similar experience as my flight in London. I did not get a gate assignment until 30 mins before my flight. I rushed to my gate just to have to stand at the gate for over 2hours because of a delay. The gate had a jet bridge but for some reason was not functioning so although we were delayed already all passengers had to scan ticket then proceed to stairwell going down a couple flights of stairs. Since it wasn’t a normal stairwell there was no window to actually see the situation outside. Once you got to the bottom of the stairs only then did we realize we had to walk in the rain with our carryon to board the plane from the tarmac. Because the rain and distance we were going by groups making a stop under the jet bridge and waiting for the boarding line to clear to go up the steps to board the plane. Again, since we were late we had to stay in the sky in line to land. The majority of passengers with connecting flights missed their flight even though there was layover plenty of time. I had a 3 hour layover. My flight was at gates C at Heathrow terminal 5. We landed at gate A2. I barely made it to my gate before they closed the doors. I had asked the flight attendant for water because I could not stop to grab some in the terminal. She ignored me and never came back. Thanks to the nice passengers next to me she offered me her water as she could see I was exhausted and needed it.
Again, due to the delay when i barely made the flight so of course my bags didn’t make the flight. When I got to PHL I had to fill out a claim for my lost bags which I was sort of expecting. What I wasn’t expecting though after 3 days my baggage arrived and my luggage was broken. It was taped up with some of my contents hanging out. The worst part was that was my luggage I had souvenir and items I purchased for myself. Only 4 out of 14 of my souvenir made it home. Also missing were two of my purses I purchased on my trip there. I put in a claim but still have. It still have not heard back.
Overall I am very disappointed in my experience especially since it was my first ever international flight as well. It was not well organized. Passengers interaction could also be improved and response to issues resulted in damages could also be improved as well. I’m hoping that others have a better experience than me but this has me thinking twice if I want to do British Airways again for my future international flights.",1.0,Philadelphia,Edinburgh,International,May 2024,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
"British Airlines caused a delay on our first flight and cancelled our connection just before we landed. We got held in security due to the cancelled tickets and ended up missing the connection which we might have made if BA hadn't just rescheduled us without notice.

Not to worry though. The BA staff were happy to demonstrate some classic racism by referring to only the Asian members of our group as 'their type' and 'that lot'. Oops didn't know the white guy standing nearby was in the group and heard that eh?

Well, our lovely exemplars of British racism weren't done yet. the 4 star hotel we were vouchered into was actually a mold infested motel with everything that could resemble an amenity closed and locked off. 

Our party had 2 documented nut allergies which of course were disclosed to BA, so of course every single item of food offered was contaminated. 

BA was kind enough to offer us death by nut curry, death by nut bread, death by nuts in mixed rice, or death by nuts in the salad dressing. Deciding to choose life we ate snacks from the nearest gas station down the road. 

Best part of this is that BA was very clear that we were each owed 600 euro according to their policy and we were given a pamphlet on how to file a claim. 

What BA doesn't tell you is that they screw over so many customers that all these rebates have a 'back log' 5 months into their 30 day process BA reps told us they hadn't even looked at the claim yet. It actually took a demand letter from a lawyer for them to even offer the minimum rebate.

"Hello Travellers,

As we all live a fast pace world of Travel we always look dor reasonable proced  airfares for Business or Pleasure. 

My joirney began by looking for my first flight experience with British Airways on June 12th 2024. I booked by travel through Beitish Aiways website in Premium Economy for a 9.5 Hours each leg flight to my destination. 

All the effort to get to our seat has been with children was for nothing less than a nightmare. The hostess started to disengage themselves from serving food to kids as soon you ask for help or a question for bring meat to vegetarians( due to their dietary restrictions) hostess will be  angry you and you are marked during flight. 

The service started to go down hill during flight all the way from Houston to London. 

The layover started to feel like a war zone. The airport is not connected to any of the terminals. 

Any flight arrivals with a connection should have their connections in same terminal unless there is a brainless airport operator who do not care about any ounce of passenger safety. 

The pssengers deboarding have to look for a bus to board and be driven 5-6 tormented  miles around the airport to access the connection departure terminal. This is level of service the British Aireays are trained to handle world travlers projecting themselves as a developed world class airlines when infact they are nothing but a over developed airline and brainless staff. 

The next episode of teavle nightmare
 began and I would love to write but I am too nice to leave this to your imagination and  the worst part of second leg of my travel   Because I want to travels to themselves is this airline worth your penny or a second of your time in your travel plan 

The London Airport is one busiest useless airport for passengers where you will be met with a warlords ( immigration agents and secuirty screening agents). A small hand sanitizer will ruin you place in line and in a full body pat down and an army of gun totting agents forcing you to strip. 

The final destination is in sight. After arrival at the destination the best part of my travel has unfurled. BAGGAE LOST. More than  100 people of the plane either lost or misplaced or no idea where the luggage is. 

British airways must retire with their fleet along with mindless hostess and not boast to be a world class airlines. Unless you have offices to handle people agony of mishandling everything about travel when flying your cheap nasty ugly overrated airline.

I am an executive silver member and arrived at lisbon Airport on 12 June we were early and therefore were looking forward to taking advantage of the the ANA lounge. As with many of these lounges in foreign airports they are not always easy to find which does nothing to add to ease your journey.  At lisbon the lounge is in fact on the 6th floor. We got up there to find the ANA lounge was closed but the TAP lounge was opened.  However BA cared so little about their frequent flyers that no alternative arrangements were made for example negotiating with TAP for their customers to use their lounge whilst whatever was going on with the ANA lounge terminated.  This is on top of waiting a year for BA to respond to missing our transfer flight on a journey that was through BA.  I was considering trying to book some extra flights this year to keep my silver status but I will rethink that strategy as its not worth the effort of my loyalty.,1.0,Lisbon,London,Europe,June 2024,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
"We were trying to travel from Amsterdam to Mexico-City with a layover at London Heathrow. Unfortunately, our flight was slightly delayed, but we were able to embark the plane shortly after. While everyone took their seats, the flight attendant announced that a 'strange message' had appeared on the airplane screen, which they were trying to solve.
 
The staff's attempts to decipher the strange message took over 4 hours. Meanwhile, we had to remain seated. After 4 hours the flight attendant announced the plane sadly would not be able to depart due to said message. We had to get off the plane again and collect our luggage at the bagage belt. During this process, one of our backpacks has been lost. 

Shortly after, I received an e-mail containing a 'new flight offer', which would depart the next day. For obvious reasons, we were not fond of that idea. After a quick Google Search I found out another plane was departing to Mexico-City, directly from Amsterdam with Aeroméxico, that evening. I tried to reach BA's customer service, which succeeded after calling 7 times and multiple numbers. The staff member I spoke to told me that I already accepted the offer to depart next day, which was not true. I persisted to rebook us to board the Aeroméxico flight, which we were able to in the end. 

We had to spend an entire day at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport waiting for that next flight. British Airways did not offer us any food or drinks, apart from one small bottle of water and a tiny bag of salted crisps in the plane. For that reason, we had to buy ourselves lunch, dinner and drinks. We finally arrived to Mexico-City more than half a day later than expected, completely burned out from the long and frustrating travel. 

Pursuant to the Air Passengers Rights Regulation, we were eligible for a 600 EUR compensation as well as a sufficient amount of food and drinks. I filled in a form raising a case 3 days after the initial flight date. Up until this day (5 weeks later) I have not heard one thing from British Airways, even though I spoke to contact customer service more than 3 times.

"Flew back from London to Newcastle, we had a flight attendant who insisted that we put our small carry on luggage under our seat. I informed him that my husbands laptop should be allowed to stay in the overhead compartment, which he reluctantly allowed. My carry on bag, even though I told him I had fragile items in it, he insisted that we should leave all the overhead compartments empty for passengers that had larger luggage. I could not fit the bag under my seat or the seat in front of me because I was worried it might damage the two items that I had bought on my trip. I had to sit with my legs at odd angles to accommodate my handbag and small carry on. My sciatica has flared up and I limped from the aircraft. This male flight attendant insisted that most people must fit their carry on bags under their seats and most could not fit them.

"We travelled on two flights in BA business Class, BA0662 outward leg to Larnaca, Cyprus on 22/5/24 and BA0665 return leg to Heathrow on 8/6/24.  Our experience of both flights was bad.
When we got to the business class cabin, I thought we were in the wrong cabin!  Unfortunately this was not the case confirmed by our seating position.  I'm not a tall person (5ft 9ins), yet my knees touched the seat in front.  The seats were uncomfortable and very hard.  With the the greatly reduced leg room and comfort the cabin did not reflect business class.  There were three seats, the centre seat not used, at least not yet.  With BA's direction of travel to degrade business class it may only be a matter of time before the seat is occupied.  It seems BA business class has moved to Premium Economy in all but name.
Now for the meal service.  If you think this may be the bright spot; forget it.  The meal service was so chaotic that on the outward leg we wound up with DIY cheese roles, making McDonalds seem high class.  For the return leg a bacon role which I didn't have to prepare myself.  Wasn't I lucky!
To go with desert, on the return leg there were 48 people in Premium Economy, sorry business class, and just one toilet.  The result of this I'll leave it to your imagination!

"We arrived from Glasgow to find our afternoon flight  in terminal 5 was over an hour late due to technical issues. The flight did board about an hour or so late so wasn’t too bad at this time. When everyone was aboard and it was a full flight it was evident quite early we were not going to take off any time soon. For the next 5 hours we sat on the plane with the pilot breathing us occasionally that the technical issues were minor and would be fixed soon.
We were served cold drinks and snacks eventually and when the meal service  commenced we knew the plane wasn’t flying today. The meal was awful to be honest and my wife’s gluten free just as bad. Why were we allowed to board in the first place? Why did we not get another plane? When we were eventually allowed off the plane we were given a booking for a local hotel in terminal 4. We finally arrived about 9:30 pm tired and hungry, the hotel put on a buffet but it wasn’t good with no gluten free options.

We took off over 24 hours late as the flight was delayed and not cancelled. The same crap meals as the day before were served mid flight. There is no room in economy to try and eat or drink ant your seat and when the person in front reclines their seat it causes a domino effect. Some of the older BA. staff were flippant and rude during the 2 days. We had lost a day’s holiday and had missed 2 excursions which were pre booked and paid.

"Almost everything about my flight was great. If it were not for the crew, my rating would be non-existent. The reason for my rating is the business class layout. It is absolutely horrible!! The passengers literally have to climb over each other to get to the bathroom or to grab their stored bags…one lady almost tripped!  For service, the poor flight attendants have to constantly pass the food or drink in front of you to then “hand” it to the adjacent passenger.  Also, if you’re unfortunately seated in a middle seat, you’re almost touching your neighbour!  It is so awkward and uncomfortable!!  There is no privacy or respect!

"I have always been a fan of British airways and can never complain about the care of their staff and especially the cabin crew. They have always been exceptionally diligent and caring. 

However I have found my recent flight experiences to have fallen below the standard that I expect from British Airways business class particularly in the following regards: 

Seat Allocation - Seats now need to be purchased in order to have people in your party sat together and the allocation algorithm clearly does not review the passenger's age as it set our 3 year old son to sit on his own.  As previously stated the cabin crew are excellent and sorted this out for us. 

In flight meals - At the beginning of our flight our chief cabin crew member (Keith) introduced himself and gave each person a menu for the in flight meal. Turns out, he shouldn't have bothered as anyone further back than row 4 (there were 8 rows) was destined to have the veggie option due to the overwhelming popularity of the meat option. In a cabin of 36 it seems ridiculous that 18 people had to have the veggie option whether they wanted it or not. 

Lounges at Heathrow - One of the lovely holiday perks of paying for business class is to enjoy the lounge before hand. BUT on this occasion we were met by someone at the door and told it was full and to go to the lounge at the opposite end of the terminal (and the opposite direction from our gate, which we had to navigate with a toddler) 

However the redeeming quality about the south lounge is that there is a childrens play room.... which we got to enjoy for 10 mins before heading back to the other end of the airport to get to our gate.",3.0,London,Aberdeen,International,June 2024,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0

"I strong advise everyone to NEVER fly British Air. I know we will NEVER do so again. 

We had business class seats booked for an early morning flight from Heathrow to SF --and then the flight was cancelled the evening before the flight.  We luckily checked email before we went to bed and found out. We then called BA, and after waiting 20 minutes someone to answer the call, the person who finally did said he was going to move us to a United Air flight leaving an hour later from Heathrow to SF. He told us the flight number and said he had booked us business class seats. It took a long time to get it all worked out, so we got just a few hours sleep that night.  

Then, however, when we got to Heathrow early the next morning we found that the BA person did not complete the booking as needed and United could not give us seats. They said we needed to call BA to get them to complete the change-- but despite numerous attempt we could not get anyone to answer the phone at BA. Finally, by the grace of god, after hours of stress trying to figure out what to do, we found a United ticket agent at the airport who personally called BA for us and got it all worked out. So, after being at Heathrow at 7 am, we ended up leaving for SF late that afternoon totally exhausted. 

The United air ticket agent saved us and allows us to get home. She also said these problems were common with BA. They 'don't treat people well' was her comment.

"I had a wonderful experience on BA flight from London to Nairobi on 19th May 2024 .
My previous flight from the Charllote SC  was delayed so I had very little time left to connect for Nairobi but two things worked wonders for me while transiting through Heathrow Airport which I consider one of the friendliest airports and efficient BA  'check in' services .
The on board atmosphere was good:  cabin crew was very friendly and professional while meals were delicious.
Interestingly, the crew went round  the plane more than four times during the flight  asking if any passenger needed  something above the normal on board services.  The arrival terminal 1E at JKIA airport was also  perfect because there were few passengers  checking out through it.",5.0,London,Nairobi,International,May 2024,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

Worst flight I have ever been on.  The guy in front of me decided to recline his seat while I was eating spilling my food all over me.  I asked him if he could move his seat up so I could clean up he refused then his wife did the same and spilled my husbands water all over him.  The guy was tall so he then decided to push on his footrest recline so much the entertainment screen was hitting my knees(I am small and have never had a problem with people reclining their seats). After about an hour of the seat hitting my knees became extremely painful plus I could not see the entertainment screen my husband asked the guy to move his seat up slightly again he refused by now my knees were so painful I was crying (it’s not a great look on a senior) my husband went to the stewardess her reply there is nothing they can do.  I endured another 3 hours like this and I tried to get out of my seat to go to the washroom as I was crying so much in pain I had to put my hand on the top of his seat to try and get out he then started to yell at me.  A stewardess came over and told me well he paid extra to get extra legroom I had to remind her that I paid the same to have that extra legroom again told there was nothing they could do.  I had to hobble off the plane crying I could not sleep when I got home as my knees were so painful and today I can barely walk.  I do not have a problem with people reclining their seats but this was extreme where I as the same paying customer was physically harmed by another passenger.

"I recently had a highly disappointing experience with British Airways when booking flights from Edinburgh Airport to London City for a concert. I purchased the flights through PayPal, but when I attempted to access my booking, it was nowhere to be found. 

Upon contacting the sales team, I was informed that no booking had been made. This was frustrating, as PayPal confirmed that the payment had been taken and advised me to resolve the issue directly with British Airways. After numerous attempts to get in touch, someone finally located the booking.

Due to the initial hassle, I was told through the app that while I would need to check in at the airport, my sister, who was traveling with me, could check in via the app. I assumed this was a gesture of compensation for the inconvenience. However, upon arrival at the check-in desk, I was told that my booking had been canceled, adding to the stress and confusion.

This situation was particularly distressing as my sister is epileptic, and stress can trigger her seizures. The original flight cost £170, but on the day of travel, the same flight was priced at an outrageous £500 for a one-way ticket.

The overall experience was horrific. To add insult to injury, I was told I would receive a callback within four weeks after lodging a complaint upon my return, which is simply unacceptable.

There was hardly any room to move and I had to climb over passengers and squeeze between seats to access the aisle.

I complained to BA about my experience, they apologised, added 12,000 points to my executive account (which cost BA nothing and  surely they will take back or they will expire as I have no intention of using their service ever again ) and, get this, they informed me that they are revamping their business class cabin to business class suites in the future ! How INSULTING !!! how is that going to compensate for my being short changed and ripped off by BA on my flight I ll never know !

This wasn't the case. After waiting for several days I contacted them myself and instead of the 21.99 reimbursement that I can use towards a nice meal on holiday they've given me 5000 AVIOs...

"Wednesday 8th May and we were travelling from Dublin to Heathrow London on board BA Flight 0835.

We were due to depart at 13.10 and landing at 14.30, a scheduled flight time of one hour and twenty minutes.

Boarding was due to commence at 12.30 but started early at 12.20 and we walked out to the aircraft and climbed the steps to board. When completed the doors were shut earlier than anticipated and we waited and waited.

The Captain did announce that we would staying put for another twenty minutes due to problems at Heathrow

The aircraft finally pushed back from it's stand and we were airborne at 13.40 which was half an hour later than scheduled.

We were travelling in the Club Europe Cabin so we were offered food and drinks from the bar. We travelled with three seats, the central one was adapted to create a table between us. The legroom was minimal, nothing extra there.

Ten minutes after take off there was a combined food and drinks service. The choices were either chicken tika salad or beetroot and feta salad, sounded awful so we declined. Did say to the member of the Crew serving us that the food options were lacklustre, uninspired and awful. He was most apologetic and said there was nothing he could do about it, he did offer us another drink and packet of snacks. From his response it was obvious that he has heard the same comments over and over.

We landed at 14.35, five minutes later than expected, with a good slam on the brakes, it took a further ten minutes to reach the Terminal, the doors opened five minutes later at 14.50.

Ridiculously we were on the aircraft for nearly two and a half hours for a fifty-five  minute flight.

We were waiting such a long time for our baggage I went to the  Customer Service desk to see how much longer it would take the cases. Spoke to a rude woman, Kin, she was constantly chewing gum, all to much trouble, she said it could take forty minutes to an hour for the bags to come.

The bags arrived at collection point at 15.25 which was thirty-five minutes after landing. It amazed me that this was BA's dedicated terminal and it takes so long to unload their own aircraft.

On this occasion they wanted to charge me for the privilege of giving up the outbound part of my fully paid return flights. This seems like an incredibly pointless way to irritate customers?? Especially when they could potentially increase their revenue even further by reselling the seat.

"Absolute WORST airline we have ever flown on!  First - the crew was late in Chicago so we left almost an hour late, with no updates while waiting.  Then we had to circle Heathrow for close to an hour.  We were so delayed that we missed our connecting flight and could not get on another flight for 11 (YES - ELEVEN) hours.  When we asked if there was someplace comfortable we could go to, (knowing full well there is a lounge for airline passengers) we were told about a *quiet* area with reclined seats.  WHAT A JOKE!!!  The reclining seats were hard plastic and the *quiet* area was only quiet when the alarm wasn't going off, which happened every three minutes.  We had the WORST seats on the plane.  There was less than 5 inches between our seat and the back of the seat in front of us.  No chance to stretch legs at all.  I am convinced they had extra space for a half row and thought 'let's go ahead and put another row here anyway'.  My husband and I were squished in the middle two seats.

"I had my return flight changed a month out so I lost an entire day of my holiday - not ideal but I had to accept it. The day before my return flight however they changed it again, this time by a whole day. This meant I'd miss work as well as book another night in a hotel etc. After receiving the second change email I called B.A to try and get a new flight.

Things had been bad up until now but they managed to get a lot worse. The call center operator (they have offshored all of this by the way - it's embarrassing to see our national carrier not creating jobs in the U.K) insisted I had already accepted the new flight when I never had. I had accepted the first change a month back - never the second. In order to change my flight to something more reasonable they wanted to charge me!

This resulted in a lot of back and forth while I argued my case, after being put on hold for 30 mins while she talked to her manager they eventually reversed their stance. The flight I ended up with was routed through Spain, I would lose the entire day but at least be back on the same day to fulfill all my responsibilities back home.

"This is pretty unprecedented for me; I only usually take the time to review, on TA, if service and standards are 5* but on this occasion I have to make an exception.
I have travelled both economy and business class with various airlines, always from Manchester but was persuaded that for, my luxury holiday in Corfu, BA club class from Heathrow was a “must” owing to great service etc. so we travelled for an additional couple of hours to Heathrow. Ground staff were great, hence 2 stars not 1! However, flights both ways were delayed (no reason given) and onboard was a joke!
It was impossible to get to the toilet, as the galley was permanently blocked by the food cart- no room for them to move it aside 🤦‍♀️ and, as we don’t drink alcohol, no drinks for over an hour: the champagne was flowing but no alternative on offer (club class)
The meals were delivered in a totally random order, starting in row 9, then row 2 etc, quite comical but frustrating because, as mentioned, the galley was constantly blocked. We didn’t elect to eat the meals (we’d paid but just chose not to) and I ordered a “toasty” and paid for it: it took one hour 15 mins to arrive. 
When flying business with other carriers, there are plenty of ,complimentary,  alcoholic and soft beverages- not on either of these flights. It really was dire!
The senior cabin attendant on homeward flight was warm, engaging and a genuinely nice guy (another reason that this review is not 1 star!) but honestly, this was by far the worst standard of service and facilities with any airline, in my experience- organised chaos!

Manchester was good didn't have a problem.

Heathrow coming back that was totally different. Checking in we never been to Heathrow and so totally different to Manchester we asked a airport staff member for help and told us to go and join the queue so we queued thy was a very rude and unhelpful  British Airways staff said you need to go back and print or boarding passes as we walking away he was saying something so I just turned and said we never been to Heathrow we asked a member of staff and told us to queue here he never said a word.

So boarding passes in hand then checking bags in with the machines they where a nightmare everyone complaining about the machines anyway they was very little staff members about to help, the one that  was about was a young lad he was 20 years old his first job he was lovely very polite and helpful I can honestly say he was the only staff member we came across that was help and polite and is a credit to the company .

Then plane home I have never come across airhostes with bad language messing around and talking about other passages and laughing with another member of staff I couldn't believe that the standard from British Airways was so low.

 I fly frequently with jet2 and they standard are extremely high and they budget airlines.

First time we flow we BA and my impressions was not good to say your driven to deliver the very best experiences well not in this case. It was very poor.

Jet2  are really good they go above and beyond so what am trying to say is never mock a budget airline because they doing alot better then the top airlines.",1.0,London,Manchester,Domestic,May 2024,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0
"The worst customer service ever. We arrived in Beijing on 1st May for a 24 day multi location  holiday, the first problem was our flight was delayed  and there was a change of gate without our knowledge,  whilst we were waiting in BA business lounge . On arrival into Beijing we learned that our bags were delayed for 3 days .By the time  the ground staff had processed all the passengers affected,  our arrival at the hotel was 3 hours later than planned, and our plans to rest before our evening excursion in our day room which we had paid for at an extra nights rate was wasted, which was due to the delay at the airport filling in forms etc. We had to cancel our planned  evening's excursion,  to go shopping to buy clothing and toiletries. 
When trying to process the delayed luggage claim , the ground staff hadn’t given us a claim number and therefore we couldn’t complete the form. While still in China I had to have a online chat to get the claim number to complete the form , the wait was long as I was 26 in line, eventually I got through and was in line for 25 mins only to be told that as I wasn’t the lead name on the booking, and therefore they couldn’t give me the number required. I advised them that the lead booking person ( my Husband) was sitting beside me and I could pass him over to allow them to give him the number, unbelievably they insisted that he had to go online and do his own chat !!! I said surely the could just ask him the security questions and save us more wasted time on line, but they refused.  My husband went online again another long queue to the chat , got the number required and we tried to complete the form. The number give was incorrect!!! 
Still not able to complete the form, I complained to BA who apologised and offered a 200.00 e voucher , but ignore d my request for a correct claim number , or to use all required information needed to process my delayed baggage claim, which I had provided the in the email .
I have since sent another 2 emails and haven’t received a response.",1.0,London,Langfang,International,April 2024,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0

"Friday 26th April and we were travelling on board British Airways Flight BA 2643 from Malaga to Heathrow 

We were scheduled to depart 14.35 and landing at 16.15 locsl time, a flight time of two hours and forty minutes, Spain is an hour ahead of the UK.

Boarding commenced at 14.00 and completed 14.35 and the doors were closed. The aircraft pushed back from the terminal at 14.40 and was airborne at 14.52, just under twenty minutes later than scheduled.

Before take off the Captain announced that the flight time would be two hours and fifteen minutes.

We were travelling in the Club Europe Cabin we were offered drinks from the bar and a meal. The choice of main courses were  chicken tikka masala, spinach and ricotta cannelloni or roast beef with potato salad, not the most exciting or enticing choices.

Our seating in the Cabin comprised of three seats with the central one adapted to become a table. The legroom would not be considered generous.

Roughly twenty-five minutes into the flight and we were offered our first drink from the bar. This was quickly followed by the meal bring served. The crew paraded up and down the aisle serving the meals, for some reason they omitted to serve us any food. We waited for a bit to see if anything would happen, nothing did. Asked a member of the Crew had we been forgotten, we had been. After a well used apology format, we were asked if we would like some food, we were not really bothered with the selection, so we declined the offer.

The was another round of drinks before the Cabin was prepared for landing, which we did at 16.05, ten minutes early, always a bonus.

The only benefit of flying Club Europe is the ability to board and disembark the aircraft before the passengers in the rest of the plane. Having said that, the boarding at Malaga Airport was pure chaos. The legroom was standard, nothing special and the service was hardly impressive, they forgot to serve us our meal.",2.0,Malaga,London,Europe,April 2024,3.0,2.0,N/A,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0

"I flew from San Diego international to London Heathrow, the first leg with the final destination of Paris, in April 2024.

I paid an extra $1500 for an upgraded seat, Economy Plus which gave me more leg room, extended chairs and better food.

This flight is almost 11 hours, and the seat I was assigned had a broken leg extender. I mentioned this to the flight attendant and she said she would send someone over which never happened.

 I ended up having to ask again and they sent over a senior flight crewmember. He looked at it and said basically we'd have to take the chairs apart and get an engineer to fix it and offered me a BOX to put my feet on which would've been more uncomfortable. 

This senior crewmember took my email address and said someone from customer service would contact me and most likely reimburse me some of the upgraded fare, which NEVER happened! 
I ended up having to make 2 separate complaints on the website. It took them 3 weeks to get back and they offered me a measly $50 for a future flight which has a short expiration (I'll basically never get to use). 

I don't fly long distance very often and I picked British Airways because I had flown with them before with no issue, about 10 years ago. Plus I get Alaska Airlines miles in which I fly quite frequently.

Completely dissatisfied with this response, for an upgraded seat I could not use and they give me $50 as a credit?  UNBELIEVABLY  RIDICULOUS. 

I will definitely , think twice about using British Airways ever again. The 11 hours was really hard, created more back pain and leg issues for the rest of my trip…

"BA basically only works if you're one of their elite members. If you have silver status or whatever you can change flight if your one is delayed, get exit row seats if your legs are too long, etc. If you're just a normal paying customer though, you're at the bottom of the pile. Flight delayed for 4 hours - tough, they don't even explain what's going on, let alone try and help fix things. 6 foot 2 legs in seats that physically don't fit? Well you should've paid for the executive treatment. There's no communication, staff bat you away if you ask questions about delays or cancellations - because all the flexibility they have for when something goes wrong on these very overbooked and cramped flights  is used up looking after clubcard members. This airline costs so much more than budget airlines like easyJet, but unless you're part of their club it's actually a worse service, because you're literally a lower tier of customer. I'm sure it's great of you're a frequent flyer, but if you're not the higher prices just aren't justified.

"I can't give zero. We booked Business Class to fly back from Athens, and were informed several weeks before our flight that Danish Air would be flying us home. I was wearing a surgical boot as I had recently had akle surgery and wanted the extra leg room for safety (think DVT), and for comfort. We paid in excess of £800 for the upgrade. Business class constisted of a curtain dividing it from Economy. That was it. Same seats, which were extremely uncomfortable. Same leg room. The only difference was that the middle seat was left unoccupied. This is not Business Class. This is a con. The in flight service was absolutely appalling and even though we were given a menu card at the start of the flight and I was sitting in seat 5A, one of the options was no longer available AND two passengers in front of me weren't eating. However, a woman sitting two rows behind me mysteriously got that option. Makes you wonder.

"I honestly feel compelled to write this review. Firstly, every single contact I have had with this company has been nothing short of a nightmare. I was originally due to travel last year but I had fallen very unwell. They agreed to ‘hold’ my booking. I kept an eye on flights and finally found some. I called to book but they advised that ‘their’ prices were £5,000 more expensive than what I had found online. After 10+ hours on the phone, many failed promises, flights booked without my knowledge, 5 emails, dr’s letters verified twice, I am still no closer to resolving this issue. I was finally advised to book my flights myself and the original would be refunded. They’ve then refused to do as promised. I have NEVER in my life experienced such poor customer service. This airline is supposed to be a premium airline, so it’s even more absurd the way they treat you when you call. I have been treated like I’m dirt on their shoes. What’s even more absurd is the fact they outsource their calls to a call centre in India. The UK economy suffers yet they’re doing this. As usual with large companies I feel I’m wasting my time and it doesn’t matter what they do as they have already built up their place in the market.

So for a while I've read a raft of comments about British Airways and how it has deteriorated . I've even heard this from my well travelled in laws who live in the USA. BUT I TRAVELLED IN MAY 2024 MANCHESTER TO HEATHROW AND HEATHROW TO DENVER RETURN. I HAVE TO SAY MY EXPERIENCE WAS SECOND TO NONE. PLEASE HAVE IN MIND I HAVE AKSO TRAVELLED WITH MANY OTHER AIRLINES TO THE STATES AND WiTHIN EUROPE AND TO AFRICA.. NOTABLE WAS IMPROVED QUALITY IF FOOD.... ALL MEALS WERE BY FAR THE BEST ON ANY FLUGHTS THAT I HAVE HAD. SLIGHTLY DELAYED ON TAKEOFF THE PILOTS MADE UP TIME . TWO OF OUR FLIGHTS WERE AHEAD IF TIME. OUR CAPTAIN MANAGED TO GET ON A PATTERN OVER LOBDON GIVING US SUPER VIEWS IF THE CITY CENTRE WHICH HE ALERTED US TO. THE GHERKIN. SHARD. LONDON EYE  HMS BELFAST. AND THEN WEMBLY ALL IN GREAT DETAIL.. FLIGHTS WERE COMFORTABLE AND THE SERVICE WAS EXCELLENT. FINALLY ON THE WAY BACK FROM DENVER WE GOT TO SEE AND PHOTOGRAPH THE NORTHERN LIGHTS FROM THE SIDE DOOR WINDOWS.. AGAIN ALERTED TO THIS BY THE CREW. THE ONLY CRITISICSM I HAVE IS ABOUT HEATHROW AIRPORT ITSELF.. WHICH WAS OVERCROWDED AND SUPER BUSY. ON THE OTHER HAND LONDON REMAINS A MAJOR HUB AND THE UK REMAINS AN EXCITING DESTINATION SO THIS IS UNAVOIDABLE. IN TERMS IF BOOKING FLIGHTS AND DURING COVID HAVING TO REQUEST REFUNDS UNDER DIFFICULT AND UNPREDICTABLE CIRCUMSTANCES MY EXPERIENCE IS THAT BRITISH AIRWAYS TREATED ME WITH THE UTMOST RESPECT AND MADE EVERY EFFORT TO ENSURE MY BOOKINGS SUITED MY NEEDS.

"We flew on British Airways on May 4, 2024 from Dallas/Fort Worth to Barcelona via London.  We were headed for a short stay in Barcelona before boarding a cruise on Norwegian.  For a family of 4, including a thirteen month old baby, we had 8 pieces of luggage.  British Airways managed to lose every single one of them.

We were told that there was a 'mix-up' and they were working to get the luggage sorted back in London but had no idea where the baggage was or when it would make it to Barcelona. One bag managed to show up on a later flight that night after we had already spent five hours at the airport waiting.  Another two showed up the next day, but the final 5 pieces of luggage never showed up and that included food and medicine for our baby and the car safety seat.  The baggage personnel in Barcelona was incredibly unhelpful and calling British Airways gave no further information other than it was the passengers problem.

Had it not been for Norwegian reaching out through their channels and getting the luggage delivered to one of our ports during the trip we may never had seen the luggage again until well after our trip.

British Airways offered nothing of compensation or refund or upgrade to make up for the mishap.  In fact another company went out of their way to ensure we were comfortable and had what we needed.

We will NEVER fly British Airways again and I would not recommend to a friend.  Several friends back home who have been planning trips via British Airways are now cancelling to book on other airlines.",1.0,Dallas,Barcelona,International,May 2024,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0

"I was returning from visiting my son in Seattle to Heathrow. (I bought drinks and snacks deliberately because of poor service by BA on my way out.)
The flight leaving Seattle was two hours late. Firstly they were frantically trying to persuade passengers to delay their flight.. the plane sent was allegedly too small, leaving 30 passengers over capacity. 
Secondly they claimed the catering company were on the plane and no one even the crew  could board until they finished. Next, the crew are on board but the catering company had left a mess and they had to tidy up. 
Folk with connections were told, nothing could be done until we were in the air. A very worrying time for them. Thirdly once we were on board, the staff looked fed up, disinterested, if anything totally unsympathetic to worried passengers. The food was poor. Breakfast was a bacon roll, no choice seemingly. 
Unlike other airlines, there were no drinks offered during the nine hour flight, other airlines offer iced lollipops and water or juice. 
Staff training is in great need. They don’t smile, look untidy and everything seems an annoyance to them. 
On my way from London to Seattle, a member of staff shouted at a passenger for ringing the help button, they needed help because the entertainment monitor wasn’t working…. the staff had not switched it on. No apologies to the poor embarrassed passenger.

"Our flight outbound ran smoothly and efficiently and we were very pleased with the service. Unfortunately the same cannot be said for our inbound flight home. The check in desk did not open until 1 hour and 25 minutes before our flight was due to depart, something I have never experienced, leaving us with little time to no time to get through security and browse any stores within the airport and an extremely long queue at the desk. On board there was no food to purchase other than crisps and chocolate which was very disappointing as we had not eaten since 9am and food was somehow still available for those in the higher class though, my guess would be due to poor time management as check in was also late as stated and possibly there was not time to load sandwiches etc on board which I feel is unacceptable as passengers did not have time to eat at the airport because of the late check in and then could not purchase food onboard.
Upon arriving home we then endured a 40-45 minute wait for our luggage to arrive as luggage from another flight as well as our own was being loaded onto the same baggage collection belt causing a large queue of passengers waiting for baggage in one area. As stated before our flight outbound ran smoothly so I would like to assume this is an unfortunate experience and if booking with British airways in future this would not happen but I am weary of using them in future.",3.0,London,Tenerife,Europe,May 2024,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

"BA have become super greedy, plus they use poor business tactics - they bite their nose to spite their eyes. 
My fight on 11st May in the morning with other provider was massively delayed and there was a BA filght in 2.5 hours time with check in desk open. Not a massive queue. A few people from my delayed flight had the same idea - to see if we can buy a ticket for this flight. BA obviously quickly realised the demand and swiftly increased their ticket price from 70 to nearly £500 for return! 
There were plenty seats available, so I thought they would wait until last minute for opportunity to sell at highest price and then maybe reduce the price to allow more customers to afford their flights as it was not filled in anyway. 
But no, they didn’t reduce and all those who wanted to buy tickets for more reasonable price chose not to go with them as it was silly to pay extra £400 to save 3-4 hours. 
I would pay perhaps an extra 50-100 but 400 for the sake of 3-4 hours is ridiculous and not worth it.
If they made more reasonable many customers from my delayed flight would go with BA. Obviously nobody bought for an extortionate price
Their business approach seems silly as they chose to fly with empty seats rather than taking up more customers from another delayed flight which would somewhat increase their income.

"DO NOT FLIGHT WITH THIS AIRLINE OR ANY OF THEIR AFFILIATES !! ABSOLUTE SCAMMERS AND MONEY HUNGRY CORPORATION PREYING ON THE MIDDLE CLASS!!!! We arrived at LHR on Sunday at 2:20pm – we were running late due to lack of experience with London traffic and went to the Self-Check In kiosk to receive our boarding passes and head to the line to check-in our bags. We were surprised to see that our tickets could not be printed so we went to speak to a Representative. Shortly after we started speaking with Charlie, he told us that our tickets had been cancelled because we did not board our initial flight (we booked 2 separate round-trip tickets in February 2024). We then had a family emergency and had to make our way to mainland Europe before our flight to London. We have NEVER flown with British Airways before this (and WILL NEVER AGAIN) so we did not know that we were supposed to call if we were going to miss a flight?!!? Especially since they DID NOT CALL OR EMAIL SAYING OUR TICKETS WERE CANCELLED !!!! With that being said, we did not call and instead, we remained confident that the flights that we BOOKED, PAID FOR AND HAD CONFIMATIONS FOR, were still VALID to get home. We NEVER received an email saying that our tickets were cancelled or no longer valid, or that we would not be able to board our flight home to the USA. WE HAVE NOT BEEN REFUNDED OF OUR ORIGINAL FLIGHTS EITHER! They confirmed that there were still seats AVAILABLE on our original flight (BA0189), but he explained to us that we would have to book BRAND NEW tickets at the current rates for a “Last Minute Booking” (even though we had booked these 60+ days in advance) and that we could not book it with him and had to CALL the Customer Care hotline who then charged us an ADDITIONAL $350 TO PROCESS THE TICKETS ?!?! and only told him ONCE THE ORDER WAS BASICALLY COMPLETE. My fiancé had to book NEW tickets at the current rate of $2,668.12 per person for BASIC ECONOMY, spending FIVE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS to get home. So here we are, an ocean away from home with a $5,336.24 bill standing in front of us and little to no help from BA. I was hysterically crying; We work modest jobs and make a little over $5,000 a month COMBINED. We saved for so long to be able to afford this trip in general so to be given a $5,336 bill to get home was EARTH SHATTERING. And as I am crying and my fiancé is shaking, THE MANAGER SAYS TO US 'I KNOW THIS IS A DIFFICULT SITUATION BUT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND, ITS REVENUE FOR THE COMPANY' !!!!!!!
After that heinous comment, we gathered our belongings and stepped aside to speak with the Customer Care representative that was provided to us from the BA representatives at the airport – We did as they recommended and we were then charged an additional 300 GBP / 375 USD to BOOK new tickets – something that I could have done manually on my iPhone FOR FREE. Completely defeated, we went back to the desk about 35 minutes later and gave them our new Booking Reference number to board flight and then they told us that this NEW flight that we had JUST booked with THEIR Customer Care unit has CLOSED ITS CHECK IN SO WE COULD NOT CHECK IN FOR THIS NEW, $5336, FLIGHT. So, we had to then pivot AGAIN and board a LATER flight going to JFK instead of EWR, which is an extra HOUR and 20 MINUTES in travel time once we landed in the USA. We then were REBOOKED, which was 2 hours later than our original flight, to an airport that is 1 hour and 20 minutes further away from our home than EWR. $5,336.24 + 3 hours and 20 minutes of additional travel time + no meal accommodations on the plane. I have SEVERE food allergies; I carry an Epi-Pen with me wherever I go, and I had to Pre-Book a Vegan meal for our original flight. With all the changes and cancellations, I was put on a 7-hour flight with no food. We were given two $10 vouchers and access to the lounge. However, $20 in an airport can barely buy you a prepacked sandwich (that I cannot eat anyways) and 15 minutes in a lounge does NOT remotely equate to the $5,336.24 expense and pure stress that we have felt since Sunday. We have been losing sleep over this bill. We submitted a claim and will not hear back for 4-8 WEEKS & THERE IS NO PHONE NUMBER - EVERYTHING IS DONE ONLINE VIA A ROBOT CHAT!!!!!!

"Tuesday 16th April we travelling on board British Airways Flight BA2645 from London Gatwick to Malaga, Spain.

We were scheduled to depart at 16.25 arriving at 20.20. A scheduled flight of two hours fifty-five minutes as Spain is an hour ahead of the UK.

Worryingly we did receive an email from the airline, the night before, advising us of the possibility of a delay due to Air Traffic Control restrictions due to adverse weather conditions over Europe.

Thankfully this was just a precautionary notice and on the day everything went smoothly.

We commenced boarding at 16.00 and was completed at 16.18 and doors closed. The aircraft pushed back from the terminal at 16.30 and airborne at 16.43, roughly eighteen minutes behind scheduled.

We were informed by the Captain that our 1,100 mile flight would take two hours and twenty-five minutes and that we would be arriving ahead of schedule.

We were travelling in the Club Europe Cabin and we had three seats, with the central seat adapted into a table. However the legroom was a bit miserly and we were not overly impressed.

Shortly after take-off we were given the menu card detailing the food options which were, black rice and quinoa salad, mushroom and leek pie, Caeser Salad with flaked salmon and lemon and thyme chicken, not very inviting.

About half an hour into the flight we were offered a drink from the bar, which was served with a small bag of nibbles. The crew commenced serving the food about forty minutes later 

By the time the food trolley had got to row 5, we were in row 7, the Caeser Salad had run out as only four were loaded. When we were offered a meal we declined and advised the member of crew, serving us, that the options were poor, she agreed with us 

Once food served and cleared in this was followed by another drinks round. Shortly after that the cabin was made ready for landing.

We landed ar 19.51 Local time which was almost half an hour ahead of schedule, always a good start a holiday.

The aircraft was an Airbus A320

Landing early is definitely deserves a very good rating, however poor food and miserly legroom certainly lower the rating. We certainly not recommend Club Europe as value for money.",2.0,London,Malaga,Europe,April 2024,2.0,3.0,N/A,3.0,2.0,3.0,N/A,1.0

"Just returned from the Portobay Falesia Hotel and loved it! We booked a holiday via BA holidays at a very good price, it included side sea view room* half -board and transfers (additional cost) really good value for money! 
Firstly, let me say we were running late (due to traffic) to the airport but as we checked in online it was easy to do the bag drop – BA staff at the airport were helpful and we went through the ‘fast lane’ rather than queue.

On arrival it was easy to find our transfer kiosk and we only had to wait about 10mins before our driver came for us. We had a shared minibus with just another couple (who were so nice, pity they were not staying at our hotel) The journey took appx 35mins and we were dropped off in front of the hotel. (we later realised that some of the other tour companies do not offer this especially if your transfer is a standard coach, some will not go up the hill and have left holiday makers with luggage at the bottom of the road)

Hotel is beautiful, lovely, and very clean, it is right by the beach (via steps down to beach) Check in was quick and easy, staff very welcoming and courteous. On initially entrance to our room, it was nice and clean (although a little tad tired) and had everything we needed. The balcony is a good size however even though it is a side sea view room* it does face a car park. 
We wanted to pay the additional cost to try and change the room but there were none available at that time. To be honest where the room was positioned you quickly forget about the car park, you get a lot of sun in the afternoon, and it is ideal for sunbathing and chilling. There are many amenities and places to lounge in this hotel, the grounds and pool areas are well kept and clean.   We would happily stay in that room again!

The beach is beautiful and is adjacent to the hotel with direct access via steps appx 120. It is not as bad as it sounds and there is seating at each level should you need to rest on your way back up.

There is a bar/café that does snacks and meals with lovely views across the beach/sea etc. There are toilets and showers so you can spend the day comfortably.  The beach has many comfortable loungers with parasols attached. To  hire for the day it is appx 10 euros.

The food in the buffet restaurant was amazing, plenty of choices and they catered for everyone. Staff were always on hand and really looked after their customers (shout out to waitress Lara and all the staff /chefs in the restaurant) 

Housekeeping was visible every day and were friendly, they always asked if we needed anything as we chose not to have the room serviced, we were only there for a short time.
On our last day we wanted to spend it on the beach as our flight was in the evening and check-out is at 12pm. The hotel will provide you with a room to leave your belongings and a pass to continue using the facilities, however we wanted to have the comfort of staying in our room longer and was happy to pay the additional cost, thank you to reception manager/supervisor ( I think her name was Deborah, it began with a D) who was able to rearrange and organise this for us! 
I know this is a long review, but we really enjoyed our stayed at the Portobay Falesia and are booking again this year for a longer stay, we will book with BA again as we found they offered a better experience that some of the other tour companies!",5.0,London,Faro,Europe,April 2024,4.0,4.0,N/A,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0

"Wednesday 1st May and we were travelling from Heathrow, London to Dublin on board British Airways Flight BA 0836

Boarding was due to commence 12.40 with a departure time of 13.20 and landing at 14.40 an estimated flight time of one hour and twenty minutes.

A member of the ground crew, announced that boarding was slightly delayed due to 
cleaning and sanitation of the aircraft. At 13.00 Club Europe Class passengers, zone 1,  were asked to come forward which we did, then stood there till boarding commenced at 13.20.

We, along with other passengers, found the ground crew to be totally disinterested and appeared rude.

Boarding was completed at 13.40, the doors shut and the aircraft pushed back from the terminal at 13.45 and was airborne fifteen minutes later 14.00, this was forty minutes late.

We were travelling in Club Europe Cabin Which meant that we had three seats between us with the middle one acting as a table. There was no additional legroom, so disappointingly not overly spacious.

The Captain made an announcement and apologised for the delay, caused by late arrival of the aircraft and a technical issue that needed to be sorted. He did say that he would endeavour to make up some of the lost time.

Ten minutes after take-off the crew passed through the cabin offering Club Europe passengers a snack. There was a choice of Quinoa salad or avocado salad, neither appealed, we declined not the stuff we would eat, egg mayonnaise sandwich would have been great.

Hot on the heals of the food trolley followed the drinks trolley, we were offered additional drinks during the flight.

Was not impressed with most elements of this flight, ground crew, delay, legroom and food. The redeeming feature was the Crew, Sarah the Cabin Manager was superb a true professional.

"Our flight from London to Tokyo was canceled less than 1 hour before we were due to fly. We were all checked in and waiting for the gate number to be called - we were told at the airport by a member of staff that there wasn’t enough staff scheduled for the flight and that’s why it got canceled. This meant we missed transfers etc after we arrived in Japan. Our flight was not rearranged for over 24 hours. On top of this when we received our baggage back from the plane after it all got taken off both of our bags had clearly been thrown off the plane onto the tarmac as we had purchased brand new bags for our trip and they were broken and severely scratched.

I spoke to citizens advice about the situation and they said we were liable for the highest grade of compensation. I lodged a complaint with BA in January and their team have still not contacted me. After calling multiple times at the 2 month mark I was told ‘the more you call the further back in the  cue your complaint will be.’ So I stopped calling in the hopes that I would hear from them soon.

Can't call to speak with anyone to clarify, chat bots have no clue. Wrote a formal complaint, in hopes I could find out what extra information BA need but simply put back in the queue by them logging another claim???? Go figure? If you need to contact BA, Forget it.

"We did a lot of research before booking first class tickets for $8,000 for each ticket. We expected a flawless experience. When we got seated, we found out that my spouse's electronics and TV system were not working. We could not relax when we got on board because we spent the first hour and a half working with the flight manager to reboot the system and try different things to get it to work. They couldn't get it working and said they would be submitting a report and we would get significant compensation for the problems. Our dinner was also terrible as well and inedible.

When we got home we had not received any correspondence from British Airways, so we wrote a complaint. The response from them was that they would give us a credit towards a future flight of 100 pounds. Really!? After what we spent, our flight was a disaster and that's what they offer? 

When in London, we told a taxi driver about what we went through and he said that it was known that British Airways had gone downhill, the planes were old and having mechanical problems and was not a good airline to fly anymore.

"My flight leaving San Francisco on the night of March 31, I believe was a 777 wide body - a huge plane, with approximately 76 business class seats. Fortunately, my broker had reserved my seat in the smaller business class section, immediately after the first class area. The British Airways business class cubicles and seats (yes, they can convert to flat) are very comfortable. The door that can close is convenient  (I was initially concerned after reviewing on YouTube because I'm claustrophobic but closing the door did not bother me, in fact I liked having that option) and helps mute the noise of the flight attendants walking back and forth throughout the flight. After several business class flights on Virgin Atlantic, Air France, and KLM, I would rate British Airways in this group as excellent and the seat is comfortable (with plenty of storage space, unlike American Airlines) on long-haul flights. The space between your seat and the area where you can rest your feet is convenient. The pillow and blanket offered is also pleasant. Given my experience with the above airlines, I have learned to not have great expectations for the food that's offered. If you can plan in advance, if one is offered, I highly recommend ordering a light meal. Overall, I would definitely fly British Airways on another long-haul flight. *FYI, be sure on your return to the U.S., you don't book a connecting flight prior to your final destination. Because your connecting flight is your first entry into the U.S., you must clear customs, collect and recheck your luggage and go throughTSA security check prior to taking your final destination flight.

"British Airways is an an airline I always avoid wherever possible.  They are the most likely to strike and they are the only airline in 20 years to lose my baggage. The greatest area of weakness is Customer Services.  As a reluctant Executive member I raised a concern of inflexibility with them.  Three months on I am still receiving emails stating 'we are sorry for the continuing delay, but we are very busy.' If BA got things right the first time they wouldn't be so swamped with queries and complaints.

The flight in question  last week was average.  Positively, it did depart and arrive early.  There was reasonable leg room in economy and the food just about eatable.  The one area of negative impact is the 'snobby' attitude of many of the cabin crew. They need to recognise that they work in a service industry and that, if they don't want to do that, they should look elsewhere.

"This has been the the worse experience I have had with an airline. They lost our luggage on the way to Barcelona. We flew in 2 days ago and we leave on a cruise in the morning. When I spoke to the lost luggage desk they told me it would be here on the next flight and we would get it that night. I asked if it wasn't there would we get compensation for it, since we had no clothes and would have to go shopping. The guy literally laughed in my face and said no they don't do that. Low and behold no baggage that night. We called and after an hour wait someone finally picked up and said it would be there the next morning. No bag. Same thing happened again that night. Now today, I have been sitting on hold for over 2 hours waiting for them to answer to give me answers about what happened to this bag they keep promising me.

I'm a tall man (2m) and will only fly BA to/from europe if I have no other choice. This was not always the case for european BA business class.

"Arrived at Chicago Ohare and asked if there was any availability to pay for an upgrade from Premium Economy to Business Class. 

Was informed there was one seat left in BC and the cost was $1,030 for the upgrade. A hefty amount, but thought why not splash out for once and travel home in style (overnight flight). 

This is where things started to go wrong…30mins later and I was still stood at check in waiting to make my payment as the lady behind the counter couldn’t work out what to do. Finally resolved, I was told there was no fast track and they were unsure if I could use the ‘American Airlines’ lounge - our departure terminal had been changed to T3 and BA do not have a lounge there. 

Safe to say, arrived at the lounge and there were issues with gaining access. 15minutes talking to the person on reception, I was finally allowed entry. Only 30mins before the flight starts boarding. A very quick drink and snack (I had BA’s business class menu to look forward too) and it was off to the gate.. 

Now, I have flown business class before and there is normally a glass of ‘fizz’ offered after boarding, alas on this occasion an extensive offering of water or orange juice was offered. My colleagues in premium economy were served sparkling wine - interesting. 

Before the flight took off my order was taken for food. I love smoke salmon and was delighted to see it on the menu, sadly I was informed they had ‘run out’. So soup it would be, followed by ‘pan seared’ cod. I was also asked if I would like waking for breakfast…100%, yes please, I have a four hour journey from Heathrow to home when we land. 

A nice glass of wine was served after we reached cruising altitude and this went down extremely well, why not have another I thought, it is business class after all. Well, what a chore that was for the attendant. No smile, no friendliness and a very clear frustration that I had asked for another glass. I didn’t ask again! 

The food, well, the soup was nice and I wouldn’t complain. The cod for the main course had never seen sight of a ‘pan’. Total slop and surely not what BA business class should be serving. The cheese and biscuits for desert were good and I thought to myself,  breakfast can’t be worse, surely. 

Time to put my head down. The seat is good and the full flat bed is comfortable. Sweet dreams…

‘Good morning everyone, this is the flight deck. We will be commencing our decent into London Heathrow in the next 10mins. The weather is…’ 

What about the breakfast I had asked to be woken up for?!?! 

I asked the stewardess and was apologised too. With the same ‘happy and friendly’ way I had been greeted with when I asked for a second glass of wine 7hrs earlier. Is there anything I can have was my question..? Everything has been put away and you need to return to your seat for landing, was the reply..! 

For a $1,030 fee to upgrade to business class you have got to provide a quality service. 

- Why allow someone to upgrade without advising there is no BA lounge?
- Why allow someone to upgrade to business class if you don’t have enough food?
- Why allow someone to upgrade to business class if providing a quality service is too much trouble for some of your crew? 
- Why offer a ‘wake up call’ if you can’t remember to do it? 
- Why bother at all? 

Shocking experience compounded when my colleagues told me how well they had been looked after in premium economy. No lack of options on food, top of drinks happily offered without having to be asked for, comfy seats and they also enjoyed their breakfast 😞 

BA has a long way to go if it believes this kind of service is acceptable. What was supposed to be a treat (an expensive one), was one of the worst flight experiences I have had. Definitely the worst for price paid.

My advice…think long and hard before you part money for an upgrade with BA. Actually, stick to premium economy, it’s much friendlier!",1.0,Chicago,London,International,May 2024,5.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0
"Booked a flight in January 2024 from my home in the U.S. to Paris, France through Expedia. One leg of the journey would be on British Airways from Philadelphia to London then on to Paris. THE DAY BEFORE my flight, BA informed me via email that the BA flight had been cancelled 'due to organizational constraints' but assured me that they would rebook.

When I called to have that transatlantic flight rebooked, the customer service agent gave me a hard time and told me there were no other flights available that day. I asked to speak to a manager and was put on hold. When the agent came back, I was given an alternate flight overseas and emailed a confirmation. 

I next received an email from BA telling me that I would have a problem should i attempt to board the rebooked flight and to call BA. When I did, I was told that the rebooked flight was invalid. Upon pressing the issue, I learned that the reason BA would not allow us to fly was because we'd booked through a third party aggregator and there were no available 'discounted' seats. 

I offered to fly out of a different airport and was told that was against BA policy. My only choice was to cancel the flight entirely or to accept a rebooking for the following day. Since so many other arrangements had been made, I had no choice but to delay the trip by one day. That meant losing one day of our vacation and one night of our nonrefundable hotel reservation.

"After many years of absurd problems with the BA app I've decided to do a review, as BA never seem to do anything about it. The app is absolutely appalling, the worst I've ever used. It is full of bugs, constantly crashes at key moments, regularly behaves in a completely random manner, unable to locate data then able to locate it, then losing it again... and twice in the last couple of months has failed to recognise my seat change, instead allocating the boarding pass with the pre-assigned seat despite me changing it. It then offers no option to go back and correct the error, you have to call customer service to change your seat. This means long waits on the phone to get it sorted, complete and utter waste of time. It repeatedly fails to recognise bookings, meaning you have to enter your booking reference to locate a booking that you made on the App and that should be automatically stored there (though in recent months this seems to happen less often, it used to be all the time). It also doesn't allocate the mobile boarding pass at the point of check in, instead producing a full page telling you that you need to go to 'my flights ' (which doesn't exist, it's My Bookings) to find it. Last time it took me 5 goes to get My Flights to take me to Get My Boarding Pass, as it was skipping to showing just the remaining bookings not yet checked in. Rather than having this pointless pop up at check in, why not just take the user straight to the boarding pass so it is all done and saved in one step like most other apps? Rubbish UI, British Airways you need new software engineers. 
Overall it's unbelievable that they are so incompetent as to not be able to have a properly functioning app. The last time the customer service were extremely helpful and quick to change it, but one should not even have to call for such a matter. on top of that, recently there have been numerous problems with seats that don't function as they should, other cabin problems (recently on a long haul flight an overhead locker that kept opening noisily by itself, constantly waking us up all night, and that was Premium Economy) and more than half the time the flights are late. BA need to sort themselves out and try to return to pre-covid quality, and fix their absolutely terrible software systems. 
Thanks also BA for removing all the women's lavatories in the Heathrow lounges; now women have no pleasant, private space in which to sort themselves out before/after flights, and instead have to remain in the cubicle which others may be waiting to use (and where a bunch of men have used the toilet, always nice) meaning others wait, and we wash our faces/do make up etc right beside a toilet. A lot of lost looking elderly women wandering about looking for the Ladies, last time I was at Heathrow T5. Great move, thanks BA, really respectful of what your female customers need. You could've kept the Ladies and simply installed some additional 'Gender Neutral' cubicles, but no, you need to remove a service we have all valued for many years. At least give us back a room in which we can freshen up.

"Terrible customer service from several onboard flight attendants especially Keira Campbell!
 I recently flew with British airways for the first time to fly back home to Jamaica. I never imagined such appalling customer service would be provided by a proclaimed top airline company.

Instead I was provided with fruits and a gluten free bread for a ten hour flight with no apologies! I also have an intolerance to tap water and I was feeling nauseous so thought some ginger / lemon tea may help.

I didn’t reply to this comment but instead went to ask another cabin crew who explained it is only brewed and because I have an intolerance if the chlorine in the water is not properly boiled off then it was best to avoid this. I requested the flight attendants name and informed the cabin manager I would make a complaint. When I arrived in Jamaica and was leaving the flight I overheard Keira Campbell and another blonde older female flight attendant talking about me as I walked by, stating “who this one”? Again I ignored the remarks and said nothing so as to not ruin my holiday experience. When I arrived back in the UK I placed a complaint through the BA services, however I was surprised that they had apparently closed the case without any email confirmation, correspondence or apologies. When you try to update the complaint it only allows claims request updates. I have flown with many airline services before as I am a frequent traveller, BA airways was by far the worst! I will only be flying with Tui to Jamaica going forward and my best advice to you is avoid this airline at all costs. They have no respect for customers who are the reason for their success. Flight attendants have attitudes lacking basic communication skills, empathy and care with no reflection / remorse.

"Upon departure from Delhi, my wife discovered her in flight entertainment did not work, we upgraded to premium economy for a better experience, but it was not to be, such a long flight with no entertainment was very boring, especially as you can see everybody else around you enjoying films and entertainment. The cabin supervisor said he would put a report in and we would be contacted and compensated in some way, and he further advised us to complain, which we did. I made that complaint on 26th March. We have heard nothing from either source, so last week I went on live chat to ask for an update. The person I chatted with asked me for my reference number, I told him I had not received any form of acknowledgement from my online complaint, and he said when I filled in the form it would have generated a reference number, which I should have noted and saved. I'm afraid I did not realise I had to do that, so I did not have a reference number, so I asked him to look up my complaint from my personal details. Unbelievably that cannot be done, unless you have the reference number, your complaint cannot be traced, you cannot even find out if they actually received it. What sort of company has systems that do not populate the complainants details for reference, I know of no other company that can only access a customers file/records from a sole reference number.  The online chat ended with the agent inviting me to go back online and make the complaint again, and that I should be careful to note the reference number this time.

"The short haul sectors between Glasgow and London are always a shambles. Rarely on time and operations at LHR are horrendous.
A320 seats look nice, but are the most uncomfortable airline seats ever. Very cramped also. Most times I've flown you get dumped on a remote stand somewhere and have to wait for stairs and buses.
Long haul to Australia was better. B787 is comfortable but engine noise is intrusive. It's pot luck with the crew. Most are good, but many are not interested and spend most of their time hiding in the galley. The catering on the long haul flights was decent if you like chicken 😂
BA board their priority passengers first, which means that economy have to fight their way to their seats with the other lot blocking the aisles and overhead lockers. 
Why not board the back first if only using the front door???
On return to LHR, did I mention remote stands? 🤬🤬🤬
Whilst in Oz we took several internal flights with Qantas. What a breath of fresh air. Smooth boarding, friendly crews, comfortable seats, free WiFi and no extra money to pick seats .
BA could learn a lot from their partners in Australia.
BA are now more like a budget airline that goes long haul. Their short haul offerings are inferior to many other European airlines.

"Check in: presence of a specific area for business class is very nice, staff is friendly there too and the check in was quick. 

Lounge: lounge is quite nice too, nice food options. However I wouldn’t arrive early to go there, unlike Qatars lounge in Doha.

Seat: seat is very comfortable (club suite) and quite private. Has ample legroom and storage. Great IFE and seat was clean.

Service: service is all right, not exactly exceptional (staff is not super friendly and not very efficient, but does the job).

Food: food was good, there was quite a bit of choices and they didn’t run out of certain options which was good. 

Conclusion: Ba is a good option, however to pricing for what the actual experience is, is quite bad. Take ba if it’s the easiest option. Otherwise consider Air France.",4.0,London,Rio de Janeiro,International,April 2024,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0

I explained that she wasn't as I knew her so the dismissive lady rudely called across and said that passenger's bag was smaller, it was marginally smaller than mine.  On the plane it wasn't even a full flight, lots of space still in the overhead lockers, and others boarding after me had kept their cases with them.

"My wife and I treated ourselves to business class trip to Orlando to celebrate my retirement.  Outbound from Gatwick was superb.   But return so far from Orlando is dire.   And both flights cost the same so should have the same experience.   
From check in we were met by all I can describe as a giggling baffoon at the desk.   We were entitled to 4 32 kg bags in the hold.  We had 3 bags (23kg , 27kg and 33kg).   We were forced to unpack and reload luggage in the queue.   Ok my fault for 1 bag being overweight slightly but really.  Then they had sat us in totally separate seats which we had to ask to be moved together.   Then security which at Gatwick business class entitled us to a fast track but in Orlando we just joined the normal 45 minute queue for security.  Ok we held it together as we knew we were going to enter the club lounge of solace fairly soon.    OMG.  The lounge is rubbish.   Absolutely packed . No seats for twenty minutes until a crowd cleared for a flight.  Complimentary drinks are limited. Food is dire.   Choice of two or three hot dishes but what I would expect from an eat all you can eat £20 Buffett but worse.  And now I hear our flight is delayed to 12pm and the lounge closes at 9pm I believe.     We really are not snobs but when our flights in business class have cost over £5000 you kind of expect a very special experience.   This club lounge in orlando is rubbish I can’t get over it.

"I had a very disheartening experience flying with British Airways recently. Firstly, the staff at boarding were outright rude, lacking any sense of customer service or professionalism. This immediately set a negative tone for the flight.

Additionally, the airline’s policy on restroom access significantly impacted my comfort and convenience during the flight. Passengers without a First Class ticket were not allowed to use the bathrooms at the front of the plane, causing unnecessary congestion and discomfort. This rule resulted in long queues of over 15 people waiting for the two toilets at the back of the plane. The corridor was constantly crowded, making it difficult for passengers to navigate to and from their seats.

At one point, due to the cramped conditions in the corridor, a fellow passenger was forced to stand extremely close to me, invading my personal space significantly as others attempted to squeeze by. This was not only uncomfortable but also completely unacceptable. Imagine having an overweight person's ass squeezing on your face while he attempts to make space for a fellow passenger to walk by to get back to his seat.

Overall, my flight experience with British Airways was far from satisfactory. The treatment and policies displayed a lack of respect and consideration for passengers. I hope the airline reevaluates its customer service approach and policies to improve the experience for all passengers in the future.",1.0,London,Thessaloniki,Europe,April 2024,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"We flew out on Sunday 7th April to Orlando, we took off on time, the cabin crew were very smart, friendly and professional.  I would definitely book with BA flying to Orlando again as they fly into the new Terminal C which is much nicer, it is less busy and quicker to get through customs.
The entertainment was very good, a wide selection of films and programmes.
The food was not very good and BA seem to have got stingy with the food and drinks, they only did 2 drinks service for our 9 hour flight, unlike other airlines which do 3, they used to provide a magnum ice cream in the afternoon but now it is only a tiny pack of 2 dinky jammy dodgers.  Unlike a rival airline that has a grazing store, BA advertise they offer more but this wasn’t mentioned or appeared to be available.
The light meal before landing was either a chicken or vegetarian hot pastry which was the size of a smaller sausage roll, it wasn’t very nice and nothing else was given, no sweet cake or hot drinks as the hot water machine was broken.  A rival airline provides afternoon tea with a sandwiches, warm scone, jam and clotted cream plus hot drink.
There was only one toilet on either side of the plane for midway down the plane, normally there are two each side, it also seemed the premium economy had to use these toilets as well.
We were disappointed with the food and drinks I was shocked at how bad and lack of extras they provided for such a long flight.
I think they should charge less for a ticket, just provide drinks and we could take our own food.  The children’s meals seemed to be ok.
The trouble with British Airways they seem to be forever cancelling their flights and they cancelled our return flight only 1 day before we were due to fly home causing horrendous stress on a Saturday evening whilst in Florida.  With no UK phone service available because of time difference.

Flight attendants sought to perform a 'service recovery' through their customer relations team. Contacted by the said team slightly more than a week later with an offer of an eVoucher that can only be used in purchasing additional flight tickets with BA.

Rahul from Customer Relations simply brushed my request off as them unable to offer any alternate 'gesture of goodwill'. What the fk. Compensation in British Airways is a matter of 'goodwill'. You die in a plane crash on a British Airways flight and compensation to your family is a matter of British Airways' 'goodwill'. Fking sht of an airline. 

Pay for a ticket but don't get what you paid for in full. Compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline (so that they can disappoint you further). An ultimately self-serving, inconsiderate, undiscerning and insincere compensation.

"I have flown British Airways 4 times in the last year and 3 of them have been pretty bad.

Cancun
I flew premium economy.  The seats were comfortable which for a long flight makes a difference but that is where the positive review ends

Many people in premium economy could not get the food choice they wanted which considering the charge they put on it is pretty poor especially on a long flight

The bar ran out of any alcohol after the first meal so just over an hour in to a 10 hour flight.  Like completely out.  Not sure how that could even be close to a miscalculation.  

Second half of the flight you couldn’t even get a cola.  Literally an apple juice or water.

The second meal pre landing again was limited choice with many people in the cabin not getting what they wanted.

The cabin crew whilst pleasant were quite dismissive about any questions.  

Also WiFi was not working.

Overall for such a long flight it was a pretty poor performance for any class.

Valencia 

The worst of any British airways service I have ever experienced.  Allowed us to check in and go through security when it was already decided the flight was not going ahead.  Appparently due to bad weather yet Ryanair and EasyJet were flying.  Eventually they cattled everyone out of the terminal to try and sort accommodation for the night with a view the flight would be rescheduled for the following night.  

I spend the night by this time 2am local time replanning my business day to work around the new flight times.  At 5am local time we recieved a text saying the flight was brought forward 6 hours and we had to leave the hotel at 10am.  Thankfully I picked the text up.  We were then herded to Valencia airport again to be checked in.  Only to be advised there was another 2 hour delay.  My day at work was completely ruined.   

There was zero explanation other than lies from British Airways and refused a compensation claim on the grounds of weather being out thier control yet other airlines were doing just fine

Historically I have stayed with British Airways.  Collecting my points and used to get good stable quality flights but the past year has lead me to consider changing airlines.  I still have the return flight home from Cancun to contend with.

"Flew from Nice to London recently and decided to fly business as we had a lot of luggage. This was probably one of the worst business class flights we have ever experienced and a total waste of the extra money. Firstly the lounge at Nice was pretty mediocre to say the least. 

When you board the aircraft you notice that all of the seats are exactly the same. No extra space or legroom in the pointy end. The interior of the plane was tired and as we were seated near the back of business class, they ran out of food by the time they got to us.

London City airport is also awful, waited nearly half an hour for our luggage, you walk for miles to get to the baggage carousel, and then it's another very long walk to the Uber pick Up point with probably the worst designed luggage trollies we have ever encountered.

"Flew back to the UK in Business class on the 777 that had the club suite.  From the minute we got on until the minute we got off I couldn’t fault the flight.  The seat was ready for us and it was clean and well presented.  Everything worked and the IFE could not be faulted with a great selection of films and music.  The crew were excellent and provided great service and banter throughout the flight.  I did not eat the food as I just wanted to sleep.  The flat bed with the White Company bedding was really comfortable and gave a good sleep.

After the shenanigans of the way out there and the DAT flight, this was a breath of fresh air.  Why can’t every flight be like this?

"I booked through British Airways and had confirmations of my flight (out and back) through BA. When I tried to check in online I couldn't (so ended up in row 58), which I thought would be the only issue but when I landed in LA after an 11 hour flight the American Airlines 'partner flight' which BA should have booked for me didn't exist. I was very lucky and the AA staff helped book me onto the last seat of the next flight out.

An honest mistake (I thought) until I tried to check in coming home and the exact same thing happened. My partner (travelling with  me) had his reservation perfectly but mine wasn't there so I was placed first reserve on the last flight out of the day with hopes that maybe someone would drop out! Not a relaxing way to end the holiday. AA said I could only talk to BA about this issue as I booked through them and yet BA don't have a 24 hour helpline so I'd have had to pay £1+ a minute to phone their american line as the time difference means it was the middle of the night for the UK call centre.

I complained and all BA had to say was: not our fault that AA didn't book you in.

I disagree BA. AA were great and you were disorganised and unhelpful.",1.0,London,Honolulu,International,March 2024,3.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,4.0

"For reasons we could not quite figure out we could not check in online from Boston to Madrid or Madrid to Boston. It was so bad that the day of the outbound flight I couldn't even look up the reservation on-line. You have to pay BA to choose seats ahead of time - for us that was $83 per seat from Boston to London (one leg) so we opted not too. 

Of course, by the time we resolved the issue at check in at the airport, we were all sitting apart. The same thing happened on the way back. Our kids are minors but were okay with this. We seemed to be among other families experiencing this as my husband was stuck next to a 9 yr old sitting 3 seats away from his dad. He felt uncomfortable as he found the boy leaning against him, invading his space, etc. Children travelling with parents should be seated with them. 

I want to mention that the night before we flew out and couldn't check in, I tried calling the help line - twice. Both times I got an automated voice saying that the call volume was too high, and it hung up on me.

Return Flight from Spain through Heathrow and what a nightmare!
Boarding was chaos with everyone allowed to crowd the entry point.
The flight was OK but the washroom was filthy!
During the meal service, we were forgotten about in the delivery of food and ended up complaining after a 2-hour delay since the start of service!! We were finally given our meals but without any choice as they had run out of certain food!

"We booked premium economy round trip from Phoenix to Zurich via AA codeshare and operated by British Airway.

On our way return flight back to Phoenix February 25th, the first leg of the BA flight 0773 between Zurich and London Heathrow was delayed departure, which cause us missed the BA 0289 connection flight between Heathrow and Phoenix.

First problem is that when we dash to the terminal 5 security check point at 12:00 PM, the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until 2:25 PM if it will be on schedule, we had almost 30 min at that point, however the terminal 5 security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement, we later realized that flight 0289 did not leave until 3:30 PM. We were directed to the customer service to re-book the flight.

When we got to BA customer service transfer counter, there was only one agent available, there were least 12 passengers waiting in the lines, we were told BA was shorting of staffs due to British holiday during end of February and there was a major soccer championship match that Sunday, so it took us at least an hour and half to rebooked the same flight next day, also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to Phoenix on different flight on the same day, I had to explain it to my management why I had to take unexpected day off and missed some important meetings.

Then, the agent who re-booked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to Zone 2 of terminal 5 to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed.

We found Zone 2 and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggers will be on our next day flight with us as well.

We also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel, however no map or detail direction provided, it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal 5, by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired.

Next day, we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time 2:25 PM, I noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iPhone’s Find me feature (I had Apple Air Tag in each of my checked bags), so I checked with the gate agent, she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight! Luckily, the flight was deployed two hours, so my other bag made to the same flight.

While on the flight, the team of young flight attendants were generally pleasant, but they missed to service me meal, I did not order any special meal, and the popular chicken dish was not available when she came to my row, so I told her any chicken dish will be ok, and she told me give her few minutes and she will bring me a different chicken dish, however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash, I mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish, she was surprised and acting like I was lying to her, so I told her my meal ate by dog, so just bring me another one. I am IT consultant and flight a lot, but this is the first time.

"This was our first leg of a flight down to South America.  We were crammed into a bus from A terminal of T5 to a 'non BA branded' flight that was sitting at T4/T4.  We were not allowed on the plane for a long time and once a BA rep had come onto the bus to advise that boarding was delayed due to 'safety reasons'.

Once we were allowed to board it soon became apparent that this was not a BA flight but a 'wet leased' flight.  The operator was Danish Air Transport (DAT), who provided the plane and the crew.  The plane was old, gey and in a poor state, the seating arrangements were extremely poor with tight seats and poor leg room.  The service on board was not as the normal BA Club Europe quality and you would have had a better flight on Easy Jet, more comfortable.  The crew were poor and disorganised, not an event I wish to repeat.  We were delayed taking off to add insult to injury.

Once in Madrid I was advised from BA that my bags were still in LHR, apparently, they had been loaded but were taken off again prior to departure.  Then we had all the shenanigans of chasing our bags.

Terrible experience and one I trust we will not experience again with BA and hopefully I am not unfortunate enough to fly on a DAT flight again.

"I booked a holiday for my wife and…
I booked a holiday for my wife and child to Cape Town (ref, JW9714). I booked all the ground transport with BA, and the hotel was supposed to be very nice.
It's like a bad comedy: they got there OK, but the BA Chauffeur failed to turn up, and no one at BA would speak with them; in short, they missed their flight home.
No BA staff at the airport would assist. It then took 15 phone calls and 3 hours to get through to someone unable to help even then.
We managed to get them home and duly complained to BA Holidays, who continually sent us around the houses, with every person you spoke to denying responsibility for dealing with these events. The story is much longer than this, but BA Holidays offer no simple way to communicate it all, and it's impossible to speak with someone. We are now one month after these events, and they still have no communication despite multiple calls and emails.
As a company, BA Holidays is super quick at taking your money but untrustworthy. They have no respect for their customers and no pride in their services. In short, BA Holidays are dire in every department, from their services to non-existent customer service teams.
We are left massively out of pocket and with a bad taste in our mouths.

Dear Sir /Madam
I write to express my great disappointment with the treatment we received on my recent flight No BA 256 from Delhi on the 19th December 2023. 
I have been a member of BA Exec club (No. 22816973) for several years and regularly flew both on the shuttle from Manchester to Heathrow as well as to Madrid during the 1980's & 90's and also on long haul to New York and always found the staff excellent.
However, this was not the case on this flight, the first problem was the extra legroom I had booked for our party including my wife, Patricia Fazackerley. We discovered that the plane had been changed from the original type and the seating arrangements differed, but I was not informed of this even though we were advised at check-in that we did have the correct seats.
After discussing with one of the attendants I went forward to attempt to solve the issue with Julie the flight senior attendant, who was having a torrid time with a young foreign lady regarding the Velcro on her seat, after a while I managed to advise Julie of my issue and she agreed that this needed to be addressed and stated she would discuss this with your team at HQ. Fortunately, one of the friends we travelled with offered to change his seat allowing my wife to move to a seat next to an emergency exit, which I was under the impression should not be allocated to passengers needing assistance.
Once I had returned to my seat I raised the inflight screen which immediately fell down and struck my leg, with this I returned to find Julie to report this and she accompanied me back to my seat and saw to her amazement that the screen did fall down without any interference, she tested the arm of the unit and agreed that it was indeed unstable and advised that the problem would be reported to an engineer to be repaired. I also agreed that this should be classified as a health & safety issue. At this point I gave her my email address and she assured me I would be kept informed; this has not been the case to-date. Again, I discussed with her about being relocated to extra leg room seats to which she stated that she would only up-grade my wife on her own to a better seat knowing full well that my wife would not accept this as she will not travel alone. All the problems would have been resolved at that point if she had agreed to move myself & my wife as that would give my wife the leg room we had paid for and our friend would have return to his own seat and myself from the defective seat. Later I noted that the young foreign lady had been up graded which goes to show that an English man being polite did not have the same effect as a foreign person who continued to create a fuss.
 
My problem did not end there as when our meal was being served the screen once again fell and struct my leg for a second time which ended up being bruised and this was witnessed by a member of the cabin crew who reported it back to Julie. After a few hours the captain came to our seats and took hold of the screen and implied that I was making the whole thing up and even stated that Julie felt that I had moved the screen myself causing it to fall even though I was standing behind her at the time it happened he even stated that the young cabin stewardess had stated that I again had interfered with the screen causing it to fall. I was getting very annoyed by this time and my fellow guests confirmed they had witnessed the incidents. The captain continued with his accusations until I pointed out that a section of tape had at some time been attached to the screen arm to prevent it from falling (see pictures attached) I did have to agree with the captain that whilst he was with us the screen did not fall and I put it to him, could it be due in some way to the pressure in the cabin at 35,000 feet. Following this he took a different approach laughing and joking and suggested a couple of bottles of Champagne would help resolve the issue, I disagreed but the captain was then called away by a member of staff. On leaving the plane at Heathrow Julie offered me a white plastic bin bag containing two bottles which I declined suggesting she gave them back to the captain as I did not feel a bribe was in order, however she insisted, and my wife took them and advised that they would go to our daughter. The ironic thing was that going through security we were advised that as the bottles were not in a plastic sealed pack they would be confiscated. I explained that they had been given by the pilot as a gesture of good-will but was advise that all BA staff would know that they would not be allowed through without the correct sealed packaging. (picture attached) so what was the point.
I am at a total loss as to why after all that happen that we could not be compensated by up grading to the business class which had numerous seats free.
Please could you advise what remuneration you are prepared to offer in order to put this awful episode behind us.
Your sincerely

"I've always believed that BA could be relied upon to have high safety standards and get you from A to B in total safety. On recent flights to and from the USA, BA managed to make me question that belief.

My husband and I experienced several problems with our flights from Heathrow to Miami (outbound) and from Houston to Heathrow (return). I’ve listed them all below, starting with safety issues. Bear with me, this is a long review, but a lot went wrong.

SAFETY CONCERNS

1. We had a connecting flight to catch in Miami and we were concerned about the connection time, so we paid for seats close to the front of the economy cabin, near the exit. After a one hour flight delay, we were even more concerned and glad we were at the front of the cabin.
As the plane landed and was taxiing to the stand, imagine our surprise when a group of passengers from the back of the cabin walked down the aisle towards the exits. The cabin crew were themselves still seated at this point, and one at the front of the economy cabin shouted “Sit down! It’s not fair – other passengers have connections too.” One of the passengers replied that cabin crew at the back of the plane had said they should walk to the exits.
What did cabin crew do or say next? Absolutely nothing. They just let these people walk through the cabin and into the business class cabin towards the exits. While the plane was still full-on taxiing!
Why did we pay extra for our seats near the exit when people were allowed to jump the queue in this extremely unsafe way?

British Airways: you sold me seat reservations that were rendered useless by your cabin crew’s inability to control the cabin. I want a refund of our seat reservation fees on our London to Miami flight.

2. On our return flight, as the crew were preparing the cabin for landing, the chap seated in front of my husband was asked to raise his seat back to upright. He did so but the seat back fell immediately into the recline position. Another cabin crew member asked him to put it in upright and the same happened again. Since no cabin crew had waited to see that the seat was actually in the upright position, my husband called one over and pointed out the reclined seat back in front of him. The chap tried again but to no avail, so there was clearly an issue with the seat.
My husband told the cabin crew that he (my husband) had had a similar issue with his seat back during the flight, but he discovered that the seat recline button was jammed, and when he jiggled and unjammed the button, the seat back was fine. My husband was ignored. The cabin crew just said, it looks like the seat is broken, sorry.
As the plane landed, the broken seat back rocked back and forth significantly. How is that remotely safe?
Was the chap in front of us moved to a safer seat? No, he was not. And that would have been possible because the flight wasn’t full.
Luckily my husband and I had a row of three seats to ourselves, so we were able to move across so that my husband wasn’t behind the rocking seat. I suggested this in full hearing of the cabin crew. I said my husband wouldn’t be able to get into the brace position with a broken seat in front of him. I suggested this, not the cabin crew, who just sort of shrugged.

British Airways: I'm happy to provide details of flight number, seat numbers and cabin crew.

POOR ADVICE RE CONNECTING FLIGHTS

On our outbound flight, we had to connect in Miami for a flight to Houston with BA’s codeshare partner American Airlines.
We hadn’t flown to the US for a few years and we were concerned about the connection time, so we wanted to make sure we were aware of what we’d need to do at Miami airport. Here is the different advice that we were given:

1. BA call centre staff, about 6 weeks before the flight: your baggage will be checked in to Houston, you won’t need to collect it at Miami. But you will need to go through passport control at Miami. There is a separate ‘in transit’ corridor that you go through, which will lead you to a quicker passport control hall.

2. At Heathrow airport bag drop: we’d checked in online so we went to the bag drop area. At the entrance to this area, there was a BA member of staff and because we thought BA customer service may have given us incorrect advice (they had - see below) we asked her about transit in Miami. She didn’t know (fair enough) but pointed to a colleague who was helping two customers at one of the bag drop kiosks. She said queue behind them and speak to my colleague who may be able to help. We waited behind the people she’d pointed to, when another BA person came over and asked us to use another bag drop kiosk. We said her colleague had suggested we wait here to speak to the colleague helping these customers. She said: “There’s no one here.” I said: “He’s right there, I’m literally looking at him.” She said, “He’s only here because they needed help.” I said: “We need help.” She said, what do you need help for, we explained the transit question. She said, you need to go to manual check in, we can’t help you here.

3. At Heathrow manual check in: The lady who assisted us confirmed that whilst our bags were ‘checked in’ to Houston, we would still need to collect them at Miami and take them through customs. We would then need to drop them off again and there should be a bag drop for passengers in transit. We asked if there was an ‘in transit’ route as mentioned by BA customer services. She wasn’t sure, but thought cabin crew on the flight might know.

4. On the flight: shortly before landing in Miami, there was an announcement for passengers with connecting flights (many of whom were worried because the flight was one hour late). We were told that we would need to collect our bags in the baggage hall and there was a bag drop point at the right hand side of the baggage hall.
Sounded good. Except this bag drop in the baggage hall DID NOT EXIST. No such thing. Instead, we had to go upstairs to Departures, which involved much sprinting and stress. Oh, and the magical sounding ‘in transit’ route that we kept being told about was nowhere to be seen - I suspect it doesn't apply to passengers who have baggage to collect and drop off again.

British Airways: train your staff to give accurate information to passengers with connecting flights! It’s pretty basic.

FOOD ON BOARD

We pre-booked vegetarian meals for all our flights. You’ve probably noticed that such ‘special meals’ are served before the rest of the meals are served.
On the return flight, I received my dinner but my husband didn’t. When the ‘standard’ meals started being served, my husband notified a member of cabin crew that his meal hadn’t been served. She checked on a handheld device, which confirmed both of our meals had been booked. Turns out one of the cabin crew had ‘forgotten’ my husband’s meal. He said he’d bring it. What he actually meant was, he’d bring it after he’d served everyone else. “Sorry, I forgot it – I wondered why there was an extra meal in the oven!”
The exact same thing happened with the breakfast. “How weird!” was the response of the cabin crew. No, not weird. Just a bit rubbish.

IN-FLIGHT ENTERTAINMENT

As mentioned above, my husband and I were fortunate enough to have a row of three seats to ourselves on the return flight. Of those three seats, only one of the in-flight entertainment systems was working properly.
On one, the audio wasn’t working (cabin crew said they would log it ‘in the book’). Another crashed halfway through the film I was watching, was restarted by cabin crew and crashed again, at which point I gave up and tried to sleep.

Most things I can overlook, like food and entertainment issues, as long as the airline is safe. But based on our recent experience, I’m no longer convinced that BA sees passenger safety as the top priority. It would take a lot to convince me to fly with them again.

PS on 15 April, we got an email from BA reminding us that it was time to check into our flight from Houston. The flight that we took on 9 April…I have no words.",1.0,London,Miami,International,March 2024,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

"A comparison of British Airways to Iberia to from San Jose. We flew out business from Gatwick to San Jose.  However Gatwick is hopeless if flying BA from Scotland, there is only one flight per day from Glasgow. Therefore had to take bus from Heathrow to Gatwick and experience long delays on M25 then stay overnight at Gatwick before flight.
Checking in at Gatwick was efficient although very busy. The First lounge provided a quiet place to relax and have breakfast before the flight. The plane was an old 777 which hasn't been upgraded so the poor ying/yan business seats and small TV screen. The food was standard business menu with a good selection of wines.
Staff were all efficient and professional.
We flew back with Iberia via Madrid and Heathrow also business, this was more inconvenient due to 2 connections. However this was more than made up by superior Iberia product. Check in in was fast and efficient, friendly and boarding speedy. Transatlantic was a new A350 with doors and a superb business seat. The crew were superb, not as glamorous as BA but so much more professional, helpful and friendly. The food was also so much better. Service was quicker than BA as they used a trolley instead of going backwards and forwards to the galley. This means passengers could settle down quicker to get a good nights sleep. A320 to LHR from Madrid was also and excellent flight. 
Then LHR to EDI with BA, met by aggressive staff shouting at people to check in hand luggage as plane was full. The toilet was disgusting as this was last flight of the day it was filthy.",3.0,London,San Jose,International,March 2024,5.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0

"BA seem to have lost the plot with their club Lounges. This review is of the lounge on terminal 3.

"I’ve been flying with British Airways for years, with long haul flights to Mauritius and Maldives - Mauritius mostly. On multiple occasions we’ve dealt with multiple cabin crew members that could care less about any of the complaints we had - which included other passengers yelling at our children and making fun of our appearance when we asked them to stop. Cabin crew members blamed our child and did not hold the adults accountable for their verbal abuse. Ironically these passengers were white and they were treated with lots of care. Many eye witnesses supported us but the cabin crew could care less. Apparently British Airways does not teach their crew members not to be racist.

"I was concerned reading all the negative views as this was the first time we had booked BA and the first time ever we had flown Business class- a real treat for us chosen as we’re too old now to travel 11 hrs with no sleep! I know our views may differ to those of frequent ‘Company’ financed business travellers - we had high expectations, no comparisons, and had saved and paid for it all ourselves so BA had a lot to live up to in our eyes. The cost of the flights were very competitive when compared to Virgin. 
 Flew with British Airways from Manchester/Heathrow. BA changed the Manchester Flight 6 weeks before (we flew at the start of their summer schedule) so we had 8hrs at Heathrow instead of 2! The lounge use made the 8hrs a pleasant start to the holiday as the BA lounge at Heathrow Terminal 3  was fantastic and we whiled away time clocking up ‘steps’ visiting the other lounges that also let you in (Cathay, Quantas etc) but we much preferred the BA lounge. Everything was ‘help yourself’ with an amazingly well-stocked open bar and a range of food items on offer (which varied during our 8 hrs!!) and comfortable relaxing areas with runways views. On the return flight we only had 20mins in the lounge at Terminal 5 - very much lower standard than the one at terminal 3 and I’m glad we didn’t have 8 hrs there!! 
Cabin crew on all fights were excellent- friendly and helpful. The food was delicious - however, I haven’t knocked a rating off for this but it could be an issue - even on Row 6, when it came to ordering from the menu we were told certain items weren’t available - how can that be? Well, apparently they stock equal amounts of the menu items and once they’ve reached the total orders, they can’t take anymore- but what they don’t tell you is it varies for each row/area- so I couldn’t order fish, but my husband sat next to me could! Easy for us, we just swapped dishes but was an issue for the person behind me and there was an understandably, grumpy exchange. It’s definitely worth asking for alternatives if you’re told it’s run out. This could all be avoided by BA creating checkin a few days earlier than the current 24hrs and taking menu orders then! Problem solved!!
 The business seats were amazing - spacious and comfortable.  Good sized pillow and blanket. The Heathrow to Vegas flights were both the new 1:2:1 configuration and we were so impressed by the comfort and privacy on them.

Whilst waiting on travel insurance I called customer care to ask if they would hold the ticket as it was being booked less than 24hrs in advance - they refused and said there were 4 seats left at that price so I could wait.

The call assistant refused to put me through to a manager and insisted they could do nothing to secure the previously advertised price. The ridiculousness is that the insurance had agreed to upgrade her due to medical reasons and they would have then sold a flight more than triple the cost of the original flight.

"Hugely disappointing. I flew with my wife on a connecting flight from Capetown to London HRW booked through BA. The first leg from Capetown to Doha was with QATAR who were superb and only proved how poor BA are in comparison. Despite our luggage being booked through to HRW we couldn't be as explained by charming QATAR person at the desk as they were dictated by BA rules. We were told that on arrival in Doha we were required to rebook in at the BA desk for the second leg. On arrival in Doha after visiting three separate QATAR desks we were told there were no BA staff on duty and we would have to book in at the boarding gate. The BA flight was delayed two hours so we had no where to go through the night as had no boarding pass to get us into a lounge. Eventually QATAR staff took pity and allowed us to use their lounge.

On boarding we did eventually get our pass and boarded the plane. The comparison between business class on QATAR and BA was extreme. Whereas on QATAR you were greeted by a charming hostess who made you feel genuinely welcome the BA hostess lacked charm but was efficient.  The business class seating, in comparison to QATAR, was cramped and felt tired. The seat when sitting was one of the most uncomfortable I have ever experienced and not much better when lying down. The only good thing was that you are able to close the partition which keeps some privacy from the aisle.

As we were boarding at 3am I asked not to be disturbed but asked for a breakfast before landing. It duely arrived and to say the least was a disgrace. Two hard boiled poached eggs on a congealed mess of spinach and something else which was wholly inedible. Not good I am afraid.

"Waited 40 years for this anniversary trip! We honeymooned to London in 1984. Booked this flight with the Hotel Rembrandt combined (very nice!) Had a wonderful trip, but the flights (both coming and going) were not exceptional. Houston to London was a smooth flight, but the food was horrendous, and the seats were extremely uncomfortable. Upon landing, we waited 2 1/2 hours to disembark the plane. We landed in a field and had to walk down steps to the tarmac and then be bussed back to the terminal. The pilot was very upset and actually voiced his displeasure by saying 'Nothing is available or prepared, What do we pay these people for!?' He apologized profusely, but the experience was awful and dreadful for anyone with limited mobility. The return trip BA0195 - London Heathrow to Houston IAH Bush was the same. Even worse food, however, the seats were a bit improved? So uncomfortable to move though, that I never personally used the restroom - for over 12 hours! Shuffled to a gate in Heathrow, forced to walk down 2-3 flights of steps with luggage, boarded a bus, then we were driven to the other end of the terminal to board a plane and carry luggage from the tarmac to the aircraft. What a hideous nightmare!!!!! I've made several trips on British Airways and even British Caledonian in my younger years. They were tasteful and bordered on even having an air of elegance (even in Economy). Sadly, not anymore. I would like to see that type of service return.

Today we are flying to Cairo on British Airways flight 384.

"I felt a bit cheated with the supossed 'business class' on BA. I had great memories from flying first class many years ago so I decided to treat my family this time for a quick vacation to London. Obviously, I know the service has not been the same it was before in most airlines but this one really made it to a new level. The lounge at Tenerife is what it is, I've used it many times so really nothing surprising here and since there are no other options, that's it. I boarded with high hopes of a comfortable flight but got seated on a pretty standard seat where the only real advantage was an empty middle seat. Size and space are the same as those in economy. There was like 12 rows of business class so the cabin seemed cramped when you had to use the toilet or move around. The staff was extremely nice, that's for sure but besides the food, which you could order the same at economy and an ocassional coffee or drink if you asked for it, nothing made it different from an economy cabin flight. No in flight entertainment at all which was shocking in a new plane and no wifi available althought it was advertised, not even a sad screen showing the route, no special nothing for the kids, no bottles of individual anything (water from regular bottles in a cup, juices …same) Yep, I know is first world problems but definitely felt cheated. I'm happy I couldn't book the back trip as apparently the cabin was full (I tried at the airport but they didn't seem too interested in selling any upgrades) Since we arrived early seemed like a good idea, not for the flight itself but to use the lounge and be able to work but I tried 3 times and all 3 workers were not interested at all. Another told me about the cabin being full but when the plane took off half of it was empty and I didn't even ask to be seated together.

"I don’t event wanna give one start. 
The service here is the worst I ever experienced in my life.
 I got business class seat from Los Angeles to London (BA268) Of course, the flight got delayed as always so I got noticed the connect flight to Edinburgh was canceled and we had to wait 6 hours for next one so I still needed to take some rest before landing.  One of the cabin crew asked me to give him a blanket back before landing. Anyone else around me wasn’t asked but I gave it to him. 

5 minutes later, he came back and asked me to give him a bed sheet back next. I gave it to him and said go ahead. 
I was wearing my headphone but he asked me to take it off and said “Your attitude, Is there any problem?” 

I was so confused what he said because the problem was obviously HIM.
He didn’t ask about blanket to anyone else but me like I was his target to bully. 

His service was definitely not for business class customers. We don’t pay $5,000 to get the uncomfortable feeling. We don’t deserve that. 

The seat was weird too. They put too many seats (trying to make money as much as possible$) in the business class so you have to step over a person next to you when you go to the bathroom. 

Cups in the toilet were out so I couldn’t blush my teeth.  The plug for phone charger wasn’t working.

"I do not usually write reviews, but I felt that this needed to be said!  I have flown with BA for many years and have had a great experience with them; however, the customer service for changing the date of a booking due to a family emergency was awful.  I called and asked if I could change my flight to a week earlier due to an emergency and I was told that the flight date could not be changed due to the type of ticket I purchased. I was told that I should book a one-way flight to the UK and return on the ticket I already have. I did this and paid the additional $455.00 just to get home. The day before I was due to come back to America, I checked my flights with Expedia, and they were all ok, but I could not check in online which was unusual. I called BA to see what I was doing wrong, and they told me my flight back to America had been cancelled due to being a no show for my original flight. This was news to me as I had already left, and ask BA specifically what I needed to do to get to England earlier. Their response after hours of waiting and talking to both BA staff and Expedia staff is that they were not going to do anything for me, and I would have to pay an additional two thousand two hundred pounds ++ to get a one-way flight back to America on short notice. I asked to talk to a supervisor and was told that I could not as they would not say anything different. The person was rude and unhelpful in every way possible. As my original ticket was booked with American Airlines which is affiliated with BA, they tried to help me as much as possible, but BA would not budge on the price, American Airlines did the best they could and took 450 dollars off of the price as that was half of the price I paid for my  ticket. However, it was still out of my budget.  I feel that BA could have worked something out for me in the first place with changing the date of my departure from Washington DC, I would have paid the extra, however this did not happen, I ended up spending over 3 thousand dollars for a trip that I paid $787 for in the first place.  BA's customer service has progressively got worse over the last few years, and I will not be booking any more flights with them.

When I arrived the airport to fly home I was however told I had to pay the same amount AGAIN to check in my bag, and that this was not included. I was denied a refund as it is “policy” even though their CUSTOMER SERVICE told me otherwise and misinformed me. TEACH YOUR EMPLOYEES THE RIGHT POLICIES SO THEY NOT MISINFORM YOUR CUSTOMERS CAUSING THEM TO PAY TWICE AS MUCH AS THEY WERE INFORMED THEY HAD TO.

We booked a cruise to Japan in Sept 2024 and our TA booked us flights with BA via Frankfurt in Germany. The Frankfurt leg being with JAL (a BA business partner). We booked seats on the flights with JAL (free) and BA charged us £18 each for both legs of the Frankfurt flights. BA then changed our return flights to an earlier return which didn't align with the cruise ships arrival into Yokohama. We therefore had no choice but to change our flights to direct ones which had better times for the cruise return (they were more expensive). We submitted a request for the refund of the original seat bookings almost 2 months ago and have heard nothing from BA. Also due to the change of flights we can no longer access manage my booking and have not (despite 3 phone calls) received confirmation of our seat bookings on our new flights. We tried to submit a 'feedback/complaint' but the system shows the same 'system errors' as it does when we try to access manage my bookings. We have sent a recorded delivery letter to BA Customer Services at Houndslow requesting a refund and the various confirmations promised and have heard absolutely nothing back. We will therefore be submitting a small claim court claim against BA for the return of monies owed and compensation for the shocking customer service.

I have travelled with British Airways, many, many times in t he past.  My experience has been 90 perent positive. i didn't indicate 100% because of  

1) one time where a YVR counter agent gave me a boarding pass for EDI (Edinburgh) and I was going to BCN (Barcelona)! Thankfully I caught the error before I walked away. ..He even argued witht me saying he didn't know what the problem was! I let it go.

2)  a time when I travelled to BIO (Bilbao in Spain) and when I booked the ticket, was told I had appro sufficient legal time to change planes.Well, Flight  out of Vancouver was severaly delayed, so I now only had 30 min to change planes, including going through security...in London?? sure.... Not! When I landed, a Heathrow assistance person said no way I was going to make my flight...Well, he ran me with the wheelchair through security practiclly and on to my next flight just as they were boarding. Of course, my suitcase arrived the next day and delivered to where I was sttaying, 2 hours North of Bilbao

But other than the above, no problems I find that British Airways cabin crew are the best in the world by a longshot and I have flown with many airlines. I have always encountered very gracious and kind cabin crew

I called 1-877-767-7970 and the agent told me that 1 hour was fine so I agreed.  This was patently false.  On 3/11/24, I received another email confirming my flight changes but the email included an over 7 hour layover at Heathrow.  Not what I confirmed.  I again called and told the agent about the 1st agent and that I had not confirmed this change.  The agent told me I should take it up with operations on the website.  I spent 30 minutes looking for that but I didn’t see anywhere I could do so.  The agent gave me some different flight options and I told her I would share them with my wife and call back.  I found 1-800-247-9294 and called thinking that I was calling operations.  Who was telling me the truth?  The first agent who said my flight was fine or the 2nd who said it wasn’t.  I didn’t want an over 7 hour layover.  Who would?  When I called that number, the agent said I was on standby. He kept repeating it over and over and over.  I kept saying that I was confirmed.  Finally I just said “now what” because we weren’t getting anywhere and he hung up on me.  Moments later I received 2 emails that my flights had been cancelled.  All of them.  In not one phone call did I ever say anything about cancelling.  We were going to stick with the 7 hour layover but that last agent just kept insisting we were on standby.  I called back several times over a period of days to tell my story including immediately after I had been discarded by that agent.  In the end, I was awarded a $600 refund on my original ticket.  Investigations are insisting that I cancelled my tickets.  Why in the wide world would I do this?  My tour in Scotland is not refundable.  My wife’s birthday isn’t going to change.

"To start with a positive the cabin crew were lovely and in particular the lady dealing with me was a delight.  There however there business experience rapidly went downhill.  I fly business class regularly with Quatar and Emirates and this is always a fabulous service however BA is a very different experience.  Firstly the seat space was extremely cramped and you had to contort yourself to manoeuvre into the seat.  The tv screen was very small and ridiculously it was positioned in such a way that it had to be folded away during take off and landing.  The sound quality was almost unbearably bad and the noise canceling function was clearly not working.  It was an overnight leg and the bedding was a tiny and very thin mattress topper that didn't fully cover the seat.  The breakfast was the standard metal tray affair that you would expect in economy.  Finally the way the seats are crammed in together you sit face to face with a stranger looking directly at each other - most peculiar.  I will nt be flying BA business again, I have clearly been spoilt by the excellent cabin on the Quatar and Emirates fleet.  Yes first world problems I know but I pay the money to be able to sleep and get straight into work on arrival and BA are simply not at the quality I want or expect.",2.0,Doha,London,International,March 2024,4.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0

"BA Europe; same cramped seats on dirty old planes. Very little locker space (often none due to baggage abuse!)
don't even get a 'complimentary snack and drink' anymore- outrageous for the prices.
BA World: again battered old planes. Food is cheap rubbish.- Business class landing 'snack' a tiny 'minced up affair' made up of chemical additives and 'mixed? poultry products imported from Thailand' WTH??
Overnight, no blankets even though the air was turned down to freezing - no doubt the cabin crew were warm behind their cosy curtains that they didn't emerge from
Entertainment the WORST i have ever had to sit through.
Seats are uncomfortable (old & worn)

Staff: on all flights are increasingly FED UP and miserable.. everything is a hassle that has to be asked for (even in Business!)

Customer service; Forget it, the phones lines are never answered (twice in 3 months over an hour to answer) - Unacceptable.
Email takes months (yes monthS to reply with a generic chat bot response)

Online check-in: not possible for this airport.
Check-in/bag-drop: efficient and friendly.
Security: OK.
Border control: charmless.
Lounge?  Not here.  It's been closed 'since COVID' - and that left me feeling rather short-changed.
Boarding: my flight was scheduled for 1705, the aircraft passed the gate at 1630 and boarding commenced at 1635, to .... leave us standing outside for about 20 minutes, waiting for goodness knows what.
Welcome: OK.
Seating: my dainty 6'5' frame coped with the short legroom of 6A.  There were no other passengers in the row.
Flight-deck Nigel-count: zero.
Departure: late.
Cabin-crew: friendly and professional, as is usual with BA.
Food & drink: one of the three meal choices had gone by the time the stewardess had got to me.  The food was OK - nothing more.  I could have squeezed in three glasses of very nice champagne on this short flight but was driving.  Darn!
Commentary: good.
Touch-down to Arrivals Hall, with checked-luggage: less than 30 minutes.  Well done BA and LGW.

Booking: via the BA website, making use of a mass of Avios points.  I wanted to fly to Venice but could not get availability, so opted to fly to Verona instead.  Verona is just 80 mins from Venice on a cheap, modern train.
Getting there: a night-time drive from Portsmouth. 
Parking: Long-stay (South) at Gatwick, which was fairly-priced.
Check-in: online, on the BA app, two days beforehand.  App functionality is good.
Bag-drop: the queue for the premium-cabins' service was longer than for those in Economy.  I wasted 15 minutes here.
Security: speedy, in the priority line.
Lounge: my first time at a Gatwick BA lounge.  This opened at 0500, and there were 30 or so ahead of me, but I was able to quickly get through a couple of glasses of fizz, some hot food, and some very nice pastries.  There was ample seating.

Boarding:  my flight was at 0630 and, arriving, I was informed that the gate would notified at 0534.  Then, that slipped to 0544.  Leaving the lounge immediately, I arrived at the distant gate as boarding was already in progress.  This is the second time that Gatwick has left me hurrying to a gate.

"I have flown with BA for over 30 years, always thought it was a great airline.
My latest experience, however, has changed my opinion. 
Flying economy from LHR to Nice yesterday was a really unpleasant experience. 
The legroom in economy on this flight was UNACCEPTABLE - I am 6 foot 1 inches (185.42 cm) tall, throughout the flight my knees were firmly pressed to the back of the armrests of the seat in front of me. The back of the headrest in front being only inches away from my face. The gap between the edge of my seat and the one in front was just 17 cm!  & to make matters worse there were no air vents above our seat row. 
The whole 100 minute flight was very uncomfortable and for the first time in my life I actually felt claustrophobic in an aircraft. 
The only explanation for this is too many rows of seats - more profit for the airline.

"My company flew us out to the Philippines on business class for work. From Heathrow -Manilla then return from Manilla - Doha we flew with Qatar Airways.

I can't praise Qatar airways business class enough. From the attentiveness of the staff, the preparation and presentation of the meals and the luxury of their Qsuite and the toiletries, including pyjamas, slippers and eyemask. We truly felt like rock stars!

What let down the whole experience was the Doha - Heathrow portion of the trip. With the Oneworld partnership we were booked on BA business class for the final leg.

My colleague and I were placed at the back section adjacent each other, unfortunately all you could hear over the aircraft noise was the loud rattling of a motor (turned out to be the fridge). He was offered a seat swap in economy, which he was not happy about, but another attendant arrived and just switched the fridge off as it wasn't in use anyway.

He ordered a tea, but they must have just ran out of milk as the tea hardly had any. I had ordered my 'meal' (unlike Qatar, meal was not cooked to order from a fairly vast menu choice), in comparison with BA, I received a rubber substance that was supposed to be a wrap, was obviously heated on the plate as was partially sticking to it. I was served and finished eating, before my colleague had even ordered his.

As for the toilets in BA Business Class, an hour before we landed, I decided to freshen up. The towel bin was overflowing, there were used tissues on the floor and the toilet roll was empty. Compared to Qatar airways, when I freshened up 30 mins prior to their landing, they had no such issues and it smelt (of perfume) and looked the same as it did when I first used the toilets after take off.

Qatar airways crew treat you as though they really appreciate you flying with them and give you quality for money. Where as BA crew act as if they are short staffed and have to 'deal with you' as well as whatever other situations are happening on the rest of the plane.

I don't think BA Business is worth the extra money. For what they are charging, you are just getting  proper cutlery with extra leg room! With that in mind you would be better off paying a lot less and going for premium economy.

I for one would not recommend BA Business to any company and I have requested my company not book us on any of their flights in future.",3.0,Doha,London,International,March 2024,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0
"It seems that BA are only interested in the First Class and Premium Economy passengers. For the rest of us it was like  we were a nuisance and treated like cattle. As a 6ft 4ins guy the seat leg room was a challenge and was like  being strapped into a fair ground ride for 14 hrs in the brace position. The food was awful and BA should be prosecuted for what they call an”English Breakfast”. Also it was nearly 4 hrs between drinks being offered. The toilets were not kept supplied with towels etc regularly. The crew seemed to prefer chatting in the kitchen area, and the crew manager did not, to my knowledge and I did not get any sleep due to the seat problem, show his face in the “cheap seats” .
The final straw was when we landed we had to be transhipped by bus and it felt like 4 miles to the BA Terminal 5 . You would think that long haul passengers would be given priority to skyways. As there were only 2 buses for about 350 people it took some time. It felt as if we were being taken to Guildford not terminal 5.

Started badly with the usual BA IT mess. Showed as cancelled flight but in reality was a plane change with a new flight number. I lost my booked seat and got worse one. Had to go to the airport to sort this out in advance, inconvenience personified.

"Plane was delayed due to crew being late for the plane. We booked our seats on line before the trip as we were going over Alaska we wanted window seat which was clearly show on the plan diagram. Everyone was saying after did you see the northen light they where fabulous which we wanted to see but couldn’t due to no window! When we sat down there was no window at this seat just the cabin wall. 
The tv  didn’t work properly on both mine and the guy next to me. They moved him but no twin seats spare on this full flight for me and the wife to more.So 15hrs of playing solitaire on my phone!!!!
The flight was full about 95% English then 5 % other nationality’s so what food did they give us chicken chow min  and another chicken dish near the end of the flight! It says chicken but I wouldn’t give that to my dog! The seats are uncomfortable for a long flight everyone was aching at the end of the flight.
So landed at Heathrow later. Then we were getting the Ba1398 from Heathrow to Manchester from terminal 5 BA’s own Terminal. Looked on the board to see which gate our next flight was from it said go to A gates more info to follow which ment a train trip to A gate as we left our Japan flight at C gate.sat waiting as this plane to was late. Then looked and they had moved the plane to another gate!
B gate now and it says it’s boarding. So rushing around to find the train to take us to B gate when we get there the girl says oh sit down and wait . We said but it says boarding ? She says oh yes we do that to get people to get here faster when we put the wrong gate up!!!!
We are in our 60s rushing is not for us!!!
Anyway got the flight back to Manchester late again got to the reclaim baggage area waited for ages then a announcement came over the speaker if you have not got your bags they where not put on the plane and to fill in a form to get them back today hopefully.
So I did 4 flights with BA
Manchester to London ok
London to Singapore. Food rubbish again 95% English on board and chicken or what couldn’t be called that anywhere else! Ofull more like. But flight ok

Was so looking forward to this trip and I was let down with very poor service!

"I was travelling alone with my one year old on this international flight. 

1. My pram was taken at the airplane door. When I arrived in London I was told they put my pram with the luggage and I won’t have my pram for my connecting flight. This was done without my consent. 

My baby was so heavy to carry along with all my bags I was crying from hoe much my arms and back was paining. I was told to go this ‘this person’ ‘that person’ to get a stroller one can borrow. Yet no one had one for me. HORRID! 

TO TOP IT OFF!!!! My pram can back broken. When trying to make a claim you only get a small amount back. I had a luxury premium pram which I now how to replace with a cheap quality pram. ABSOLUTELY PATHETIC!

My pram was also missing at my final destination to top it all!

"My experience with British Airways has been very poor. We booked BA for our honeymoon and before we went on our honeymoon to Maldives we booked flights to London for shortly after this trip. BA decided to take the payment 3 additional times, putting my into my overdraft. I had to ask family to loan me money until this was resolved. I rang them and was quizzed that they need a reference but I didnt have one until 15 mins later they said there was an issue with payments. It took 3 days for the money to go back into my account and all I got was an email to say we had an issue processing payment apologies. I complained but of course nothing was done and no one has ever been in touch.

This set the tone for our flight for our honeymoon. Our flight home especially was very frustrating. Our resort was running behind because of the sea plane meaning we had to rush to the airport and get through security. We hadn't ate anything as we had no time. We got onto the plane and after an hour we had our meal which was good because we were starving. I ended up needing to get the veggie meal which was quite bland as I'm unable to eat garlic and the main meal was all garlic potatoes. I didnt understand why they wouldnt just do normal potatoes for a gravy and chicken dish. It was an 11 hour flight, they served the next meal an hour before landing. So there was a gap of 8-9 hours between the meal. They gave us crisps but it was only 2 different flavours which I really disliked and I asked is there anything else and they said sorry no. After about 7 hours into the flight no flight attendants had came in quite a while. I went to the toilet and seen a tray completely filled with biscuits, chocolate etc. This annoyed me as they never came round offering this and when I had asked if there was anything they said no. I've been on other long haul flights in economy and staff have been very attentive and regularly offered snacks etc.",1.0,Male,London,International,February 2024,2.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0

"BA056 is serviced by an A380. Regretably this flight was oversold, especially so in Business Class.  Passengers who booked and paid for Business were down graded to Premium Economy, Premium Economy passengers were then down graded to Economy, all rather like the mucky stuff, it flows down hill and takes no notice of how long ago you booked, how long BA have had your money (funding their business) nor that the trip was possibly a silver wedding once in a lifetime trip. In Premium economy on this aircraft several rows had problems with their entertainment system.  On my row of 3, two seats had screens that were U/S, my seat had a faulty audio point which only one side of the sterio could be heard - so you could hear music on the soundtrack but not the speech.  Oh and by the way, if you have any expectation of choosing the meal you want, then sit at the front of the cabin because if you are at the back, by the time they get to you, all that is left is the option nobody wanted.  If BA cared I would tell them how badly we were let down, sadly though, they amply illustrate they dont care and most certainatley will not accept any accountability.  Here is the thing, nobody can deny BA can run an airline - they will fly you from A to B reasonably safely and most of the time you will arrive pretty much on time.

On my flight out of the UK, I was told there had been a 'loading error' and there was nothing suitable for me to eat on on the 11.5 hour flight (to Costa Rica). The air steward said he would write a note on my behalf to BA -- which he did -- and I got an email from them saying how sorry they were and it wouldn't happen again. Ya-di-ya.

On my flight home, I was served a bowl of boiled rice and some dead vegetables as my main meal. Worse than any school dinner I was forced to eat a as a child! I had the foresight to take something to eat with me, so I didn't touch it.

For breakfast, the stewardess said she was too embarrassed to serve it to me. What was it? Two pieces of bread with a bit of lettuce between! Great job British Airways catering. I assume I am the only vegan flying BA!

Anyway, I wrote a complaint letter and they simply said they were sorry I had had a bad experience and look forward to seeing me again. No chance!

"Brisitish Airways Business Class
DO NOT BUY IT
Worst business class experience ever.
Avoid at all cost and dont buy business class ticket

I despite paying a premium price for a business-class ticket, I was disappointed to find that the seat I received was identical to the ones in economy class. The seat itself was extremely uncomfortable, with a hardback that offered no support. It was not adjustable, leaving me feeling cramped and unable to find a comfortable position. In fact, I would go so far as to say that I found sitting on some rocks on Snowdon to be more comfortable than the actual seat. 

Furthermore, the legroom was significantly narrower than what I have experienced on even the most basic no-frills airlines. To add insult to injury, the only discernible difference between the business and economy class seats was the location of a flimsy curtain that separated the two sections. 

I have attached some photos to illustrate the conditions and hope that this feedback will help improve the quality of service for future travelers.

Boarding was also a poor experience. They didn't even create a separate line for priority / business boarding.

I have to said The Tesco meal deal is more luxurious than the food they serve in business class.

The flight attendants did their best to make it feel like a pretend business class, but it is a rip-off to sell business class tickets and provide a no-frills airline service.",1.0,Istanbul,London,Europe,March 2024,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0
"So I learned without any prior warning, seconds before they began spraying the passenger cabin, the British Airlines flight crew would be using a spray to 'prevent spread of disease'. They advised it shouldn't cause any irritation, however, if you're wearing contacts you may want to close your eyes for 30 seconds. 
Not long after they sprayed I began to experience an upset stomach. I then felt a wave of lightheadedness (I felt flush) and had to go to the toilet. What followed were 3 bouts of diarrhea spaced a couple of hours apart. The crew showed empathy and provided me with Tonic (with quinine) and rehydration sachets to use with water. 
I'm not sure if they sprayed the plane prior to landing, as I was trying to sleep. However, within about 20 minutes away from our landing at Heathrow I woke to another wave of lightheadedness, nausea and another bout of diarrhea.
I didn't know exactly what was being sprayed until I disembarked the plane, and opened my laptop up, after passing through security for my connecting flight. Apparently it's a practice of airlines to use an insecticide chemical agent, when planes are traveling from certain areas.
I'm a Gulf War veteran that was previously exposed to low doses of Sarin and Cyclosarin nerve agents, in the Khamisiyah area of Iraq, during combat operations. I'm wondering if this has left me pre-disposed to being sensitive to Permethrin/Pyrethroid insecticide agents. 
I believe this practice of using insecticides on flights has a purpose, however advanced notice needs to be provided to passengers, and a means of avoiding exposure offered to prevent adverse outcomes. I will be pursuing this further to learn what exactly was used, i.e. requesting Safety Data Sheets (SDS) documents, and following-up with my healthcare practitioner.",2.0,Cape Town Central,London,International,March 2024,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0

The line was huge and after standing in it for an hour,we ended up missing our connecting flight because they had more employees standing around then working the counter.  Several other people were complaining that the company had caused them to miss their flights and the staff were LAUGHING at them , like seriously, how can you have the nerve to hold people up in a line for an hour because you won't allow them to get boarding passes when they check in for the first flight out of four? They ended up making us wait at the airport for 13 hours before we were finally put on a flight and then we finally get to Oslo and guess what, our luggage did not. We were left stranded in a foreign country for 4 days with nothing but our carry on luggage. When we tried contacting the company they were not helpful at all.

BA flight attendants appear to be professional and attentive when I told them my business class seat did not recline all the way to flat position. They tried but it appears to be broken. The manager apologized for the inconvenience and said someone from BA will contact me and may offer a refund. No one has contacted me so far so I tried to call BA customer service. DISASTER!!

"Myself and my partner were on flight 0177 from Heathrow to New York which was cancelled right as we were about to take off due to a technical fault (I have this in writing). Subsequently we were held on the aircraft for three to four hours where we were roasting hot. When we were in the middle of this process we were rebooked on BA113 at 16:20 flight, half of the aircraft was let off and then just as we were about to leave after queuing on the aircraft for 40 minutes we were told the ground staff was not going to let any of us off and to “find a seat as it would be a while”. We tried to speak to air stewards but they also had no information, they said we would miss our 4:20pm flight regardless. We were then held on the aircraft for a further hour before being let out into a further 3 queues where we stood again for hours. We were at no point offered a meal voucher or kept informed with what was going on. When we eventually were booked onto the 6pm flight we had to run to a station to verify that we were airside, this was another queue which we then got moved out of into yet another queue. We were exhausted and I already suffer from back problems so the length of time we were stood around really exacerbated this. We managed to make it to the 6pm flight where we had to run from C63 to gate B38, we could not use the train as advised by staff as this would have resulted in us missing the flight. We then boarded the flight only to sit for a further two hours in flight while they arranged for further catering. I made the stewardesses aware on multiple occasions that we hadn’t been given anything to eat or even had the opportunity to purchase anything since we boarded our original flight prior to 12pm on the 13th Feb 24. They advised there was nothing they could do and we did not receive our meal until 10pm and I have photographic proof of the time. 12 hours since we had last eaten and over 10 since we boarded our original flight. I don’t blame the staff as this was not their fault and they handled it the best they could in the circumstances but I felt this whole experience was incredibly disorganised. Some people were offered things and others were not. We were in the offered nothing category. All of this and these delays meant us arriving in New York at 10pm rather than our scheduled 3:38pm or 4:10pm on the app, at minimum a 5hr 50 minute delay. We then had to navigate the railway at night and didn’t arrive to our hotel until after midnight, meaning we had been on the go for around 23.5hrs. We were exhausted and missed a whole evening in New York as part of our trip so this was a huge inconvenience. The experience caused emotional distress as there was so much confusion around what was happening where and I was physically affected due to my painful back. I tried to fill out your form to claim for the cancellation but it only registers the new (albeit also delayed) flight we were put on and not our original so the form doesn’t work. I know we are entitled to compensation via eu law for the major delay and disruption this caused but further the experience we had with no food for over 10 hours due to British Airways holding us in an aircraft then the multiple queues and the run for the final flight was really not what I had expected and not the experience I would have hoped to have when flying BA.

"Upgraded at last minute as seemed a good price from PE to Business. Was looking forward to fully flat bed as I cannot sleep in the normal seats. 
Cubicles a bit claustrophobic. Sat in middle section so could be next to my husband, but he is a bit hard of hearing and what with the plane noise at 35000 ft he was too far away for us to have much of a conversation.
Fully flat bed a real disappointment. As it's just a slightly wide seat that goes flat there is very limited space in the cubicle to move once it is flat. Your feet are squashed in to a narrowing corner. You have to move your bag and shoes out of the way first and then where do you put them? Unless you sleep on your back (I don't) there is no room to turn over and the seat belt (like a car seat belt) needs to be fastened over the top of the duvet. Fair enough this is for safety reasons, but it means you are strapped down and can't move around freely. Consequently we didn't sleep a wink and actually arrived more tired and uncomfortable than we would have been in premium economy.
Meal service a bit like being in a restaurant. Food & drinks OK, but nothing special. Fast track was a waste of time as the non-fast track line got through quicker than ours.  Went in the business lounge-North. Quite busy and difficult to find a seat. Food ok, but quite limited. Drinks ok for me, but no decent beer for my husband. Just Heineken or Brew Dog. No longer do table service for food, all buffet help yourself. Coffee was nice.

"It was a terrible and stupid experience. We had a disappointing start to our journey with British Airways on the 11:40 flight from KEF to London. Arriving early at the airport with plans for breakfast and some last-minute souvenir shopping, we were instead caught in a seemingly endless check-in line. Despite there being fewer than thirty passengers ahead of us, the wait time extended to a grueling two hours, right up to the closure of check-in for our flight. Throughout this ordeal, not a single staff member approached us to explain the delay or provide updates, leaving us in a state of confusion and frustration.

It’s understandable that technical glitches can occur, but the lack of communication and absence of any visible effort to resolve the situation were unacceptable. Simple steps such as informing passengers about the issue, managing the queue more efficiently, or even coordinating with the airport for additional check-in counters could have significantly mitigated the inconvenience.

The indifference of the staff to our growing dissatisfaction was particularly disheartening. It was only after we openly expressed our discontent that we sensed a semblance of regret from the staff for the inconvenience caused, which seemed too little, too late.

This experience has severely tarnished our perception of British Airways, a company we expected to uphold a high standard of customer service and care. It’s crucial that the airline addresses these issues to prevent future passengers from enduring similar frustrations.",1.0,Reykjavik,London,Europe,March 2024,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
"We flew on 7 February to Gran Canaria with BA Club Europe. From start to finish it was an awful experience. I will list the problems in chronological order:

The dedicated check-in consisted of a single desk. When we eventually arrived the girl had no idea how to check in my mobility scooter and was on the phone for an interminable time. By the time she had sorted things out there were about 150 people behind us and many were vociferously making their frustrations known. 

Eventually we made it to the lounge which was superb. It was the only part of the trip that was worth a bit of extra money.

Then we arrived at the plane. It was an Airbus with seats in rows of three on either side. The Club section was identical to the economy section, the only difference being there was a table on the middle seat. A lady in front of us complained loudly that “This isn’t business class”. She was told that the middle seat being empty and a table and meal and drinks being provided meant it was. She made the very valid point that there is no extra legroom.

In fact there wasn’t a table for us although one was found about an hour or so into the flight. However, we didn’t actually need a table for some time because, although food and drink was being served to the economy class passengers, we had to wait a considerable time before we got anything. Food started to be served at 3pm.

We were in row 13 and, at 3.50pm, we were told that all of the meals had run out except for the  vegetarian choicet. I had two small cheese rolls and an apple crumble.

There is one toilet for the 52 passengers which meant frequent queues. This was exacerbated by their being no division (i.e. a curtain) between economy and club so a lot of passengers from the rear of the aircraft also used “our” toilet. (There actually was a curtain, but it couldn’t be pulled for some reason.)

We found the PA announcements almost impossible to hear, both outward bound and on the return. 

There is no on-board entertainment of any kind and no charging points for mobile devices.

Finally, to rub salt into the wound, not only was my scooter not delivered to the aircraft door as per the label, our “Priority” suitcases were the very last off of the carousel. My scooter arrived on a different carousel some time later.

To say I feel cheated is an understatement. This was a special holiday for my wife and I, celebrating our 40th anniversary on Valentine’s Day.

The return trip was a better experience, albeit there was no dedicated Club check-in desk and we were in one of three queues for quite some time. The Spanish check-in man dealt with my scooter in minutes and at Gatwick it was brought to the aircraft. 

We actually got a meal which was fine but very much as per the old economy class days and certainly not up to the standard we received on our other trips in Club. Equally on all other trips where we have flown business, with BA, Virgin and TAP, we got a welcome drink of fizz on boarding.

I must say the cabin staff were all very obliging and cheerful, albeit on the outbound flight they were embarrassed at the poor level of service and especially about the lack of a visible difference between club and economy and the consequent over-use of “our” toilets.

After ten days no acknowledgment of my letter of complaint, let alone resolution. I am considering legal action in the small claims court.",1.0,London,Las Palmas de Gran Canaria,Europe,February 2024,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0

"Delayed flight from SG to Sydney. Which led to me missing my connecting flight even though I was reassured in SG that I would make it with no issues. I made it physically but was denied entry because my flight was changed without notifying me and as per the staff, the paperwork was not completed (nothing I could change on my end). It was a challenge to re-book the other connecting flight - physically and mentally taxing and stressful. I had to speak to a staff at the transfer desk after a flight + queuing to get on a flight that was not for me. The staff works for Qantas and said that I needed to find a Menzies staff. I have never heard of Menzies or ever spoken to one. But was given brief instructions to ask for them at a boarding gate counter. I made it to the boarding gate and the staff were understandably busy with getting the passengers on board. So, I waited patiently for them to be done. Was then instructed to get to the other transfer desk. By then, I was so tired, hungry, thirsty and still nauseous from my previous flight. But I wanted to get this sorted asap to avoid being bumped off all of today's flights. I briskly walked everywhere with my luggage and laptop bag. Found the other transfer desk with 2 other disgruntled passengers in the same predicament. Unfortunately for me, I did not have an Australia visa (I did not get one since I didn't have to as per the original plan). So instead of a day stay which would've been rejuvenating at least, I was given a food voucher and sent off on a hunt to find a place to nap in the transit area.

"Worst First Class ever.  We were in Group 1 boarding, but something must've gotten messed up in their system during our check in as the automated ticket scan at the gate wouldn't let either myself or my wife through.  Now we had to wait on the one gate agent actually manually doing boarding passes to get it straightened out.  By the time that was done they were starting to board Group 5.  We get on the aircraft and almost all the overhead bin space has been filled up, apparently by all the other boarding groups going through First Class. So much for that advantage of First Class.  Now I'm standing in the aisle looking at the seats thinking 'you're kidding me'.  The 'First Class' seats look just like the economy seats (except for the little white piece of cloth on the headrest).  I sit down, sure enough, as far as seat width, seat cushion, legroom and seatback pitch these are economy class seats.  As my wife noted 'these seats are smaller and more cramped than regular coach seats on JetBlue' (economy airline in the US she used to fly for).   No pre-take off service at all.  About the only indicator that we were in First Class was a meal service during the flight.  They try to compensate for the crappy seats by not booking the middle seat, so, congratulations, you get to claim the middle armrest, but your actual seat still sucks.  Can't believe we paid extra for this.",1.0,London,Zurich,Europe,February 2024,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,N/A,1.0,N/A

"Horrible airline all around outbound flight  from LHR departed over an hour late because the entertainment system was down. We finally got airborne and it continued to have issues. About 3/4 into the flight the air kicked off causing it to get really warm in the cabin. 

Return flight to LHR took off an hour late. The row I was In only had power and entertainment to one seat. 

We landed 45 minutes late causing me to have a very tight connecting flight. My connecting flight was delayed and I made it to the gate with with plenty of time to spare. In fact, they were still servicing the plane from the prior inbound flight.

 About 45 minutes later, they started boarding and surprise boarding pass would not scan and the agent told me that they had canceled my ticket. 

They stated they did this because I was going to miss my connection so they booked me the following day. I explained to them that I did not miss my connecting flight. I was at the gate with plenty of time, and I wanted my old seat back. At that time they told me it had been released and allocated to another customer.  

There was no email update or any alert that my seat had been canceled had they notified me I could’ve got an outbound flight to the states that night that would’ve given me time to catch a same day flight to my final destination. Unfortunately the only option to get out of LHR was to take a flight to LAX and then spend the night there in the airport.  

The British Airways rep tried to insinuate. It was my fault even though I told him I had clearly made it to the gate with plenty of time to spare. I have never heard of a flight giving up seats, proactively and preparation for a miss connection. They should’ve verified that I was not gonna make my connection and then accommodated anyone who is on standby.",1.0,Hyderabad,London,International,March 2024,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
"To start off, on the flight out to Miami the service was incredible. Cabin crew were extremely attentive, showed an actual sense of humanism, personality and humour. Food and drink was extravagant - especially the Laurent Perrier Champagne! Seats were very comfy and entertainment was all up to date. However, the flight back to Heathrow was not in touch with the way out, the seats were quite dirty, crumbs of food were left on the bedside table, greasy smears and drink stains were left on the walls also. The flight ‘manager’ was quite rude and talked in quite a pretentious manner to me. Gave me the feeling like I wasn’t meant to be there which I didn't like at all. Other than that the remainder of the cabin crew were very professional and friendly. The food was quite bad to say the least, presentation wasn’t good and lacked in taste, it seemed as if it was just a microwave meal they found at the back of the fridge, I understand this isn’t the Cabin Crew’s fault of course but the food service needs a serious touch up. 

Overall, the flight service was amazing for the most part. But British Airways needs a serious update, so many other common fliers would agree.

"Firstly our original flight was cancelled meaning that we lost money on our travel expenses and one day of our holiday. The new flight was delayed leaving Arrecife due to a ‘minor’ mechanical issue and was full of families with young babies who were very vocally fed up with the wait. The stewardesses totally ignored everyone and were very offhand when they did speak. There was just one toilet available in the cabin resulting in a long queue down the cabin and meaning that babies nappies were being changed on the cabin seats. Not pleasant!
There were no hot drinks available as apparently the boiler was not working. Abruptly the steward replied that it was not her fault. No announcement was made to say what was or was not available and none of steward announcements could be heard. The cabin was far too hot and the children became even more fractious and it was generally a dreadful experience. We had expected a good flight on a British airways fleet but received, in fact, the worst service and journey that we have ever been on.

In the past month, dealing with the exact same issue I have had to phone them 11 times and spent almost 7 hours!!! on the phone with them.

At between 40mins and an hour the line drops because of phone problems/connection on their side because all of their staff work from home and rely on their home broadband! They are then not allowed to call back and so I have to call again and the cycle repeats!

There is no email address to complain to, no way of speaking to a manager and no way of progressing. I am fuming and I have no idea what to do next!

I'm also betting that there is a response from BA saying that they are sorry for my experience and to contact them via 'blah' to get this resolved... I have so far posted complaints on their FB, FB dm'd them, tweeted them, online webchat, done the online complaints form in addition to the several hours spent on the phone.

The plane did not have a gangway to board and I/we had to go down a couple of sets of stairs, no lift or elevator working. We had to board a bus to take us to the plane. The plane was at Terminal 3!

"I flew BA with my wife and daughter on a 3 centre holiday, New Orleans, Nashville and The Bahamas, flying initially from Heathrow to New Orleans.

On arrival at New Orleans no suitcases arrived. A tannoy announcement advised approximately 130 suitcases had not been loaded at Heathrow and we were guided to an Attendant at the end of the carousel who provided a sheet of A4 with a QR code from which you could register your missing luggage. From this point on the BA service model was cruelly exposed as being unhelpful, unempathetic, lacking in understanding and merely robotic. You are merely a reference number as identified by the back bounce email upon registering. 

In our situation two cases arrived 6 days into our trip and my case was reunited with me back in the UK. I do wonder what happened to the remaining 130 cases, because they may wish to share their experiences to attempt to stimulate an improvement to BA service model

At the time of writing this review, 4 months after submitting my claim. My claim is still outstanding, the chatbot confirms it is still pending, having been reimbursed in the last fortnight a total of £264! I spent slightly over £1k, excluding phone calls and any monetary value of the time taken out of the holiday.

The purpose of writing this review is to WARN fellow BA Customers if your luggage fails to arrive of the following:

1. You are on your own! Do not expect a heartful and genuine apology. It will be at best a robotic auto response.BA have no service structure aside from generic online chats to provide individual guidance.
2. BA's definition of essential, is extremely narrow and therefore great care should be taken in your purchases. They don't define essential, but it appears narrow.
3. Claim process is time consuming and again soleless. Upon completion you merely receive a auto generated mail with a reference number. You have no means of speaking to a person.
4. Timeframes for resolution are long. By long think minimum 3 months! That means you are outstanding the funds you have had to spend through no fault of your own for at least 3 months.
5. It is not a negotiation to resolve they tell via auto email and you respond on their automated system.
6. Do not anticipate any compensation or gesture of good will, non will be forthcoming.

I have had past experience of baggage failing to arrive, it happens. My most recent experience being Air Canada to Montreal. My experience of putting right a wrong could not have been more positive.  I was reimbursed within 6 weeks, without any questions.

Indeed an arrival in the Bahamas my daughters case was damaged beyond repair and the Air Delta attendant examined the case confirmed it was damaged beyond repair , provided a new case and even helped decant the clothing from the old to the new. Exemplary service.

I can only speak from my experiences of being a regular flight passenger. Service standards have undoubtedly dropped, but BA seem to have allowed they standard to drop to new lows. The actual flights were fine, but thereafter I could not recommend you fly BA, because if you have any issues you are no longer a person, merely a case reference number!

We booked American Airlines but because of code sharing we started our journey in Palm Springs then were given the BA flight from Phoenix to Heathrow, never again!

They go so far back that it’s like being in a twins buggy, the difference is that the twin on the bottom will not have to get out to go to the toilet or just want to move around. In order to do that you have to limbo under the seat in front…… or wait them up!
Honestly I have some arthritis and this is the reason we chose Premium as it would give us a bit more room, forget that, choose another airline or stay economy and save your money.

4. Cabin crew all seemed to be running up and down a lot, but not actually achieving much.

"Flight delayed by two hours, rude staff member who was supposed to help clean up a glass of wine that was spilt on my seat by another passenger put my seat back as if it was dry only for me to sit in it and be soaked through to my skin and smelling of wine. 

I could hear other attendants commenting on his attitude. At one point a sleepy woman was making her way to the toilet and he needed to get by her. Instead of saying excuse me he aggressively told her to 'keep moving then'. In another instance before we set off, he abruptly grabbed the pillows and blankets around a person with no communication, literally threw them in the overhead and said 'Get them when we're flying'. He was agitated the whole flight and was brash or rude with every passenger I saw him interact with. He seemed on the verge of blowing up at anyone, it was very uncomfortable to be around for a long-haul flight of 7/8 hours.

No replacement drink or food was given to me (the wine spilled on my food), no apology from him, my screen didn't work for first 45-60 mins of flight but despite flagging it no staff came to help or check, I had to keep getting up and down to find them. The one saving grace was a lovely attendant who, after I showed her the wet patch on my trousers, fetched me pyjamas from first class. 

I complained and got a response today after 3 months (14 weeks) of waiting.

The result: 
- They offered to 'contribute' to the dry-cleaning of my clothes
- Apologised for the staff member's behaviour - they've also shared the details with the 'relevant managers'. 
- Apologised for the delay to the flight. They said: 'We never take delaying a flight lightly, as we know how disruptive this can be.' 

No attempt to compensate me for my missed train and the cost of a new one. No attempt to reimburse me for the missing elements of my flight (screen-time and food/drink). And an apology for the delay in getting a response to my claim: 'We’d also like to thank you for your patience while we got back to you about this.' I got an email from them 2 weeks after my complaint thanking me in the exact same way. Why is a 3-month old complaint which must have breached their standard turnaround times being treated in the same way. It makes me blood boil.

In addition to this but not something I've ever complained about because it's too small of a matter, I've had situations with a handful of the check-in desk staff being unhelpful and just lacking basic manners. 

I also recently flew back from the states to find my 4-wheel bag had only two wheels left and was cracked at each corner (it is a hard case). Thankfully BA did a good job turning around quickly and resolving the matter and I understand this type of thing happens, but it unfortunately added to my already long list of difficulties I've had with them as an airline.",2.0,Manchester,Des Moines,International,November 2023,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0

"We travelled from LGW to Columbo via Doha which was operated by Quatar Airway. The LGW to Doha and the return, Doha to LGW, was operated by BA. Once in Columbo, we received an email from BA  stating that you have had to change the cabin and were unable to offer us the seats we had booked and paid £163 for (31a & 31c) which had extra legroom on the original plane layout. We went online and saw that we had bee allocated a seat in row 25 and one in row 26, which didn’t have the legroom we had paid for and worse, clearly were not together. We then phoned BA at a cost of £6.85 (zone D roaming), where your representative failed completely to gasp the situation and accused us of booking the 25 & 26 row seats. When I asked calmly for him to tell me why I was looking at a conformation of seats 31a & 31c together with payment receipt from BA, he simply said that he could offer us completely different extra legroom seats, but we would have to pay for them again. I then asked him again to please just answer my original question, he just said he would have to speak to the back office and placed me on hold. He then came back, stating that we could have seats 31a & 31B (which he confirmed had extra legroom) with no explanation of what had changed.  I then asked him, did he understand the stress he had put us through for the last 30 odd minutes, and cost, to which he just said if he could be of any further help, just let him know. UNBELIEVABLE!
To compound matters, we then got on the flight to find that seats 31a & 31b were in fact backing on to the toilets with standard leg room and limited recline, as apparently the plane had changed again (or had it!). So we spent 7 hours cramped and having to listen to the toilets being flushed all night.

"I had booked this flight on line quite some time ago. I had already checked in one line the day before, but nonetheless went to the check in counter to get a paper boarding card. Boarding was relatively straight forward. I was in the so-called Group 9 so I was asked to board last. Nevertheless getting to my seat, 9F on this Airbus A320 was trouble free and luckily there was still enough room above in the bins to stow my hand luggage. This was surprising as the flight was pretty full. 

Fortunately there was nobody in the middle seat so I could spread my legs out a little. We took off ca. 20 minutes later than schedule but despite going into a holding pattern over north east London we still landed pretty much on time - actually 1 minute late. 

During this short, uneventful flight, we were quickly served small bottles of Harrogate spring water and a flap jack. The flight attendants were professional and efficient. They were there if you needed them for any help.

Apparently there were five stewards in board but only two were available for the whole of economy for the duration of the flight which meant there wasn't enough time to offer refreshments to the people in the last few rows before making the descent into Palma.

"My recent experience with British Airways left much to be desired. Despite paying a premium, the onboard services were virtually nonexistent. The cabin crew appeared disengaged, lacking both smiles and basic courtesy. Business class, advertised as a luxurious experience, was in fact economy seats with an empty space between 3 seats. To add insult to injury, I was surprised with additional fees for luggage—a common inclusion with many other airlines. The age of the cabin crew ( mostly nearing retirement age) seemed to affect the quality of service, as they appeared sluggish and inefficient in attending to passengers' needs.  However, the most egregious aspect was the exorbitant pricing. A short journey from Malaga to London Gatwick cost a jaw-dropping 765 euros for economy class when booked through their website—an unjustifiable amount for such a brief trip. Overall, my experience with British Airways was deeply disappointing, and I would caution against choosing them for future travel. British airway - the low cost airline with premium pricing.

"Departure was from the satellite C building and the announced gate changed a couple of times.  No air bridge from our gate so across the tarmac and up the stairs for boarding! Departed about one and a half hours late. Don't know if any of the late departure could be attributed to BA but once aboard all these minor niggles were forgotten.

Shown to my seat by 'Tiffany' one of two crew looking after the first class cabin and then offered some LPGS champagne - one of my favourites. The seat was comfortable (the cabin hadn't been refurbished so the seats weren't fully enclosed) and the usual 'kit' (slippers, pyjamas, amenity bag, etc.) was present. Built into the side of the seating area is a handy cupboard and there's plenty of storage above and alongside the windows. The best feature is the large screen - I was able to watch four films during the flight.

The food was plentiful and well-presented but, as usual, the vegetarian options are not inspiring. The drinks menu had plenty to offer so I tried several of the white wines - very good. The only disappointed was that there was no cognac on board!

All in all, a great way to cross the Atlantic. The service on the flight was first class, as has been my usual experience with BA - it's just a pity that a lot of their customer service is very poor.",5.0,London,Miami,International,March 2023,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0

"Due to ill health we chose to go business class as we needed a flat bed.  The check in, boarding process was very good but we were surprised at how many seats there are in business class which felt and looked cramped. The aisle is very narrow.  There is one cabin with 46 seats and another with 22 which then runs into premium economy then economy.   There are curtains to separate and 4 toilets are shared with first and the two business class cabins.  It seemed chaotic for staff.  From Sydney there were no hot towels handed out but we did get offered champagne or juice.  From Singapore we were only offered water or juice which i was not impressed with.  

The steward from Sydney was brilliant, asked all the time if we needed top ups for drinks etc but on way back from Singapore we had to buzz a stewardess for everything and I wasnt served any dessert although ordered a cheese platter.  When I mentioned it she said ' oh i didnt think you wanted it you didnt finish your meal'...really?   I think thats my prerogative.   The food from Sydney was beautifully presented and lovely but from Singapore the meat was dry and tough which was why I left it.  Breakfast was awful so I wouldnt bother at all.  My wrap with scrambled egg was runny egg with a soggy wrap.  Yogurt was nice but didnt get any fruit which was on menu.  

The seats once we were in them were more spacious than they looked.  The bed was  firm  and unlike other business class airlines there was no offer to make the bed or put a soft underlay on it.  There is plenty room under neath and storage is great. 

Definitely better than economy although to be fair there seemed to be a lot of room in economy seats compared to other planes.

I thought it was annoying to have a myriad of people walking through the business class cabin to economy but thats how they do it.  

The lounge in Sydney (House Lounge) was not great at all and considering it was on my confirmation message we could go to qantas 1st class lounge it was disappointing at check in as thdy told us we had to go to the House Lounge.

The lounge in Singapore was amazing.  We loved it.

Would I fly Business class with BA again?  Yes I would if the price was reasonable but I think staff should be more organised like other business class airlines.

"BA should be ashamed. Never again we will book BA until they have upgraded ALL their long hall aeroplanes. These business class seats are 8 across,  packed in like sardines. There is no privacy.  There is no where to put anything except for a small draw on the floor that is impossible to access if your chair is in any reclining position. 
If you have a window seat A or K the only way to get out is by climbing over the person's feet in B or J respectively.  The same for the middle section seating, seats E or F will have to climb over the feet of the person in C or G. If you are seated in the isle seats there is no privacy.

Seat 1C has the extra disadvantage of people tripping on the narrowing door frame from the gallery, I assumed the corresponding seat the other side has the same problems. 4 times they nearly fell onto my husband and had to grab the TV or his seat back.
Food and refreshments.  If seated in the A, D, E or F your food & drinks are passed over the top of person on the outside seat. Its more canteen service than business class. The food was OK.

"Difficult times for airlines, and BA likely can't avoid tax like others can. Nevertheless, my image was the BA experience would at least be noticeably above that of the low-cost airlines. Sadly no longer the case - at least not for short-medium haul flights. No more legroom than Easyjet. Nothing more than a biscuit and bottle of water on a 4hr flight, tea and coffee £3 a pop. No screens or entertainment at all - which might be sort of logical if the wifi were free, but that's £5 per hour too. Ample free baggage to check in, yes, but 10-15% or so of passengers had no room above them and were left frantically looking up and down the plane for somewhere to store their carry-on bags. Above all, rather classless and frowny service from the stewardesses.

"Jan 30th, I booked a last-minute, transatlantic flight to Ireland to attend a funeral for a close friend of mine. So, the nature of the trip was bad enough as it was. It was not a vacation for me. On the transatlantic leg of the flight, BA was the airline. It was a terrible experience. A baby was crying right next to me for a good portion of the flight. That’s not BA’s fault, but just to continue to set the stage. Mid-flight they had to close both the bathrooms in the middle of the plane. I was in seat 16J, right behind one of the bathrooms. They both started leaking sewage into the passenger compartment. I could see the water coming toward me and soon it was under my feet. As you can imagine, it didn’t smell great. It made a bad trip worse and got all over a new pair of boots. I contacted BA about this and explained in great detail what had happened. Their response was essentially, “Sorry about that”. I contacted them again to verify that this was the formal response. They responded by offering me a 50 euro voucher to use on a future BA flight, which has very little value to me, if any. I contacted them again, giving them another chance to make it right. Nothing. It’s not their fault that there was a screaming baby, nor is it their fault that the restrooms overflowed, created a disgusting mess, and soiled my boots. It is their fault that they made no effort to make it right. This is not just an inconvenience. It's a health and safety issue. As far as I can tell, I’m the only one who got sewage under my feet.

Where do I start? Seating: Premium E seating is so bad that the handles between seats are fixed, u cannot lift them up for added comfort if the seat next to u is vacant.  BA has crammed 4 seats in the middle row where there used to be 3 to earn more at the expense of its passengers.
Inflight service terrible.  Inflight crew mainly British falsely polite ; they seem to forget that the days of colonization and British Raj are over. 
Food: We were in the second last row of Premium economy on all 4 sectors and were literally penalised for it.

"I was recently diagnosed with terminal cancer and could not travel so bought a ticket for a relative to travel to see me in the US from Hungary. Since we are all older, we paid extra for the flight cancellation insurance.
Shortly after we booked the flight, the traveler was diagnosed with a heart problem and could not travel. We contacted BA and provided all of the documentation they requested, including a letter from the medical center indicating his condition and a translation, and they sent us an email stating that if it got too close to departure date and we had not heard from them, that we should call. 

I did not hear from them, but they never contact me a couple days prior to the departure date. I called 4 times: 1st call: static made it impossible to hear. Call 2 person who answered said 'can't hear you' and hung up. Call #3 Dennis refused to help me because I was not the traveler even though I had a case number referring to all the documents send and I explained to him (Dennis) that the traveler was in surgery and it was unclear as to if or when he might be able to call. He also threatened me with contacting their fraud department even though they had all of the documents that I had provided and my name and information (and I paid for the trip and provided the credit card statement to prove the charges) Call #4 (Ankush)  was by the book, refused to help unless he could speak to the traveler despite knowing they were in th hospital, and refused to refer me to a supervisor. Finally Call #5 Vidhi was incredibly helpful, asked me for the case number, and found the documents so she could speak with me, and let me know they had all of the information, but then proceeded to tell me they do not do refunds. All this despite knowing that I have a terminal illness, the traveler had a heart condition and probably could not travel for many months, if ever; and that we had paid for cancellation insurance. She told me that cancellation insurance only applies in case of death, and that they only issue credits.
Furthermore, they would only issue a credit if the traveler spoke with them directly, AND had a letter from a hospital or MD stating when it would be safe for them to fly again (if ever).

"This airline has the worst customer support service I've ever had to deal with. I have placed a complaint concerning a flight connection I lost due to BA delay. It has ben one year since they said 'i have the right to recieve this money' and until now only back and forward emails with 0 attention to my situation and the loss situation they put me through. Mostly, automatic replies from the BA side with no consideration to call or sort such a long-term deal.

Besides losing the flight, on the day this happened, BA was obliged to provide a hotel to the passengers that, like me, had lost other connection flights. The condition to which they treated people waiting for a hotel room was miserable. BA personal handling this situation left me and all people in Junuary 2023, with 0 degrees outside of the airport waiting for a bus that came 1 hour after. These people included elderly people and families. 

Don't recommend it. Truly believe that cheaper and less self-entitled companies handle this situation better.

"BA CUSTOMER SERVICE ASSISTANT LAUGHS AS MY 70 YEAR OLD HUSBAND TELLS OF OUR 7 HOUR DELAY PLUS ANOTHER 3 SAT ON A RUNWAY
Continuing from below we were advised by the captain that their colleagues were working hard in London and information would be received 1 hour before landing for transfer passengers who had now missed original connecting flights and re-booked connecting flights.
Well clearly no one was working as no information was forthcoming before landing. The Captain then said that ground staff would be there to meet us and we could use the customer service desk at baggage reclaim and the customer service desk at check in.
NO GROUND STAFF ANY WHERE TO BE SEEN AND STAFF MEMBER AT CUSTOMER SERVICE SAID SHE COULD NOT HELP US - HELPFUL AS ALWAYS
We made our way to check in - No one from BA to be seen! We asked someone on the adjoining AIR INDIA DESK - she said she didn’t know anything about it but would call someone. 
At that point a young man pops his head out from the back office and quickly retreats as he sees the mow crowd of transfer passengers. When my husband asks is someone coming to deal with us “we were 7 hours delayed and then another 3 sat on the runway - we had to leave our hotel room at 10 am yesterday morning - it’s now approaching 6pm. A BA STAFF MEMBER THEN APPROACHES AND STARTS TO LAUGH AT OUR MISFORTUNE. 
We along with other waiting passengers are appalled at her lack of empathy. 
A young man then appeared and did his best to help us and other passenger but seemed inexperienced. We were then told to wait like cattle while they booked us accommodation for the night.
THERE IS MORE - IT GOES ON!!

HOUR DELAY FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER 3 HOURS SAT ON THE RUNWAY WHILST GROUND STAFF/BA CAPTAIN AND CREW and LONDON TRY TO RECONCILE BOARDING FIGURES
Update to the below review!!

IT DOES NOT IMPROVE 

All now counting passengers whilst we, the paying passengers looked on in disbelief at the farce unfolding before our eyes. 
They then ask all passengers to sit in there checked in seat.
Captain then decided they were happy - probably fudged the figures! One and half hours have now passed then another announcement saying they have to have clearance from London and take off would be few minutes. London obviously have the same problem with figures as the BA Captain, Ground Staff and Crew as is was another hour before we set off 
SO YES THAT,S CORRECT 7 HOURS DELAYED TO START WITH THEN ANOTHER 2 1/2 HOURS SITTING ON THE RUN WAY

PERHAPS BA SHOULD START GIVING A BASIC NUMERACY TEST TO ALL STAFF and APPLICANTS

At 6:00 AM - they decide to serve us Dinner YES DINNER - obviously from the original scheduled flight to take off at 8:40pm the previous day.
We are advised that this will be the only meal apart from a wrap 1 hour before we reach London 
We have no option but to eat! 

MORE TO ADD TOMORROW WITH ATROCIOUS BEHAVIOUR FROM GROUND STAFF WHEN WE FINALLY REACH GATWICK 

my original post below is below:-

I am in Barbados after a very relaxing months holiday which has now been ruined by BA.
It is 10 years since we travelled with BA and only booked with them because we had a direct flight from Glasgow routed through Gatwick purely so that we didn’t have to deal with luggage, transfer to a different London airport. 
We have now been out of our room at The Crane Hotel since 10am this morning. We used a room made available to shower and get ready for our 8.40 pm departure. At 5pm local time we were advised our flight was delayed until ESTIMATED 3.30 am tomorrow morning! We should be very grateful because BA offered us a voucher for a drink and a snack!! Has any one from BA experienced a snack at Grantley Adams at midnight ??
Absolutely appalling considering most passengers would have been travelling to GA at 6pm in order to board for take off at 8.40 today. Do they not consider that passengers are least entitled to dinner and should really expect a hotel room until midnight considering new check in time in 12.30 pm.
As we have now missed our connection to Glasgow BA have helpfully booked us on a connecting flight from Heathrow and guess what there so kind that the travel expenses plus having to cart all our luggage through London is all at our expense. WHAT OUTSTANDING CUSTOMER SERVICE. 
OH and if you don’t agree you can ring there international number where you guessed it NO ONE ANSWERS … and of course you will have to have topped your phone credit to be able to get this nonsense message. Website sends you round in circles. Basically BA have F——d Up and there all off for the weekend. What happened to 24 7 day a week customer help line for delays. 
What they want us do is accept there rebooking from Heathrow with the condition that they don’t pay for you to get there or deal with your luggage.

"The boarding started about 50 minutes before take off and we thought there would be a good chance of an on time take off. Wrong! All the passengers were seated and strapped in about 35 minutes before take was due. We sat, we sat, we sat and at 30 after due take off the captain announced that now that everybody was on board we can go. The doors had been closed for over an hour and there were no announcements about the delay. The meal was served and the starter was billed as a ceaser salad, in fact it was 3 small pieces of lettuce about 4 cms in diameter, 3 halves of cherry tomatoes and 2 shavings of parmigiana cheese. I would have expected more in a garnish to a starter. The main meal was fish pie with winter greens. I foolishly expected a fish pie, the standard one with potatoes and fish in a cream sauce mixed into the potatoes. Wrong! It was a pastry pie, the type you have on the football terrace which it itself is fine but I thought BA prided itself on the fine foods in the meal selection. The winter greens also appeared to be missing so I asked where the winter greens were and the air steward pointed to a green smear at the side of the plate. I thought the green smear was a new plate design BA had introduced because I could not move it with my knife. The desert was a cream cheese cake thing about 3 cms wide by about 8 cms long and 3 cms tall. It tasted good but it was hardly a desert in size two bits and it was gone. The meal took about 4 minutes to eat and must stand in first place for the most disappointing meal ever. I was on a 7 hour flight and that is what BA feel in a substantial meal. I am almost 75 and I have traveled all over the world mostly with BA because I wrongly trusted them but this meal was a total disgrace.

"We WANTED to like BA. We really did. It was just ONE THING AFTER ANOTHER. We flew SFO LHR INV (or tried to) then INV LHR SFO. But as we booked the trans-Atlantic part in business and the connection in coach, they were on two separate reservations. (Who knew BA was so unreliable?). So, they canceled the LHR INV leg, only offering us one the next day. So, since we made that 'error', we had to eat the cost of a train ticket to Inverness. (North of £500). But before we even got to London Euston Train Station, we had to collect our bags from the inbound flight from SFO - what a catastrophe. So, we figured by 30-45 min after block-in the bags would be spinning around the carousel ... NOT EVEN CLOSE. At Arrival +1 hour, a very famous celebrity who had been on the same flight (flanked by her staff AND BA personnel) looked annoyed, and one of the BA staff swiped the door, went out to the luggage area and personally retrieved her bags. The rest of us waited another 20-25 minutes for any movement. We kept asking, and were only told 'shift change'. Give me a break.  So, once we finally had our bags, we departed the terminal for our morning, and subsequent train. 
The flight several days later from Inverness back to London was dull, but uneventful. 
After a brief night in London (and some Christmas market fun), we headed back to Heathrow. Remember, we were in BUSINESS CLASS. We were flabbergasted to find that Business Class check-in is fully automated, no human interaction at all. This bothered us since we were already getting texts about a possible delay. We knew that we had separately-booked connections in San Francisco.  (Again, we never would have imagined BA to be so unreliable). 
So after our RyanAir check-in experience, we self checked our bags and headed to the lounge. Hot and overcrowded BA Business Class Lounge at T-5. Food was okay. Not much staff to be found. The delay texts were coming in earnest by this time. 
The gate for our return to SFO (BA285) was at a remote area of T5. Seems like it was Gate C64. That gate in no way had proper space or accommodation for 492 passengers. So, we were in Group 2. After Group 1 (First Class) boarded, we tried to make our way towards the turnstyles, and were met with 400 angry British passengers who were already annoyed at the delay, and didn't want anyone to embark ahead of them.  We ultimately were able to get on along with Group 5. 
To say that the pre-departure service was lackluster would not be doing justice to the word 'lackluster'. It was a water service. We don't feel special, or elite or anything - but we did pay a lot of money for SOME service and attention.  No value there. 
So, once the flight was buttoned-up and we were ABOUT to push-back, a 'techincal' issue arose; the door was opened. We told the FA that we were going to miss our connections in San Francisco, and wondered if we could speak to the gate agent about simply moving to the Phoenix nonstop a couple hours later. He wouldn't even entertain the idea, telling us that the B gates were in 'meltdown' whatever that means. 
So, while the seats were comfortable, we didn't really feel like we got any value for our fare. Meal service was adequate. Nothing more. Once the main meal is served, it's back to self-service for snacks. Compare that to Emirates Business Class with an onboard lounge and non-stop attendant availability.
We landed in SFO over three hours late which is automatic EU261 compensation. Nothing from BA via text/email. No one to ask in SF. Soooo? We had to enlist the help of a usurous company to extract the reimbursement from BA ... at a FIFTY PERCENT fee.  BA should have been forthright and sent each passenger an email with the form or simply just returned the penalty to our credit cards. I mean it IS required by EU regulation. 
We DID send an email, to which we received a stock apology and a $300 travel credit. (For the BOTH of us, not $300 each ... $300 TOTAL). 
But, of course, we misconnected in SFO, and had to pay for a hotel ... 
So, the problems as we see them.  1) Draconian reductions in staff - to the point  that there is no one available, even when it is urgent to speak to a human.  2) Whatever staff there is-is not only overwhelmed, but have clearly had any concern for customer satisfaction beaten out of them. Both Trans-Atlantic segments had senior flight attendants who looked as if they wanted to cry, not ANY joy or pride in the service.  3) Along with the disregard for customer experience is the disregard for EU regulation. 
So, while we can take the blame for being naive and booking our own connections, given that the added expense for Business Class on one-hour segments is unnecessary ... the complete and utter collapse of the infrastructure of BA is evident to the most casual of travelers.",2.0,London,San Francisco,International,December 2023,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0

"Terrible terrible terrible airline!! PLEASE STAY AWAY! Our connecting flight to London was delayed which led to us missing our connection. According to EU regulations, if a passenger is delayed on reaching their destination by more than 4 hours the airline must provide a monetary compensation for this delay. Not only is it the 4th month that I am waiting for this compensation but the overall saga of flying with BA was terrible. Every single one of the following flights was delayed, there wasn't enough space in the overhead bin so they forced us to check in our luggage, the UK airport security apparently has other regulation for transporting liquids so ended up throwing away the majority of our stuff (regardless of us just being stuck there in transit) but now that I am waiting for the delay compensation, which btw they are required to provide BY LAW, their customer relations team stopped responding to my requests for a proof of payment and reply to me maybe once a month with the same template that asks me to 'be patient'.

Agent 2: advised there was a fare change to which I replied I wasn’t happy to pay a single penny because the website showed me the same price I paid initially to book the tickets. 
Agent 3: same as agent 1. 
After receiving confirmation from the 3rd agent, I went ahead with the change since there was nothing I would be paying. However BA still charged me £106 without informing me.

Last year I was really disappointed in the BA Club World service but they have redeemed themselves. We took the evening flight to Dubai and had Club Suites. Since we already had a meal at the lounge and we wanted to sleep as soon as possible we opted to only have a starter and dessert (tasty grilled artichoke soup and cheese platter). The plane was clean and we got the same old amenity kit by the White Company as always which can use an upgrade in my opinion. Staff was lovely and helpful and thanks to the fact that the meal service was back to pre-covid level made this an enjoyable flight.,4.0,London,Dubai,International,January 2024,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

"Twice in a row my flight was cancelled, leaving me stranded in Madrid. The first time I stayed at my hotel two extra nights without claiming any compensation. The second time I took a taxi and it’s impossible to get this refunded as you get bounced between Iberia and BA - both claim it’s the other party who needs to do something. Some nearly 5 months later and my 500 euros are not being refunded (despite getting a couple hundred compensation) as BA want me to cancel the ticket with Iberia. It’s a BA flight number so despite the companies being merged they won’t resolve themselves and use this as a reason to keep peoples money after huge inconvenience to the passengers. I have hundreds of emails between us, where they keep repeating that I need to cancel the unused flight with Iberia before they will refund the taxi. Iberia refuse to as it’s a BA flight number. As you can see on the photo Iberia won’t accept the numbers. Quite the scam they have going. Must save them hundreds of thousands of pounds. Ombudsman and lawyers will take over when I return from my current trip. Wasted months on this. Avoid BA and Iberia if possible, I will from now on.

Once in London, (that airport is a total disaster, hot, dirty, and and extremely crowded), our next flight to Madrid was delayed, and the gate was not announced till 5 minutes before take off. Everyone was rushing, trying to get to the gate, and the crew acted as if it was our fault.  The plane we took, was not the same we were supposed to go on,  and we arrived in Madrid 2 hours late. But that was not the worse. Somehow, my husband's suitcase was missing, so we had to stand in a long line in order to file a report for a lost suitcase.

"This is the worst airline I have ever encountered in my hundreds of flights and extensive international flying experience. I booked a one-way ticket and needed to cancel it less than two days after booking it because I was coordinating with another party that was flying in from elsewhere. British Airways not only took my $1,500 and did not refund me, when I reached out to customer service to inquire about why I only had a $78 refund on my bank account statement, they gaslit me and told me to check with my bank, then they told me my ticket was non-refundable and also not changeable, all the while repeatedly misgendered me, calling me 'Mr' 
When I reached out to create a customer service complaint ticket with the transcript of this interaction, they told me that because I 'voluntarily' canceled my flight that I could not receive a refund or flight credit. No mention of their agent repeatedly calling me 'Mr.'
Most other flights will let you change your flight for a $150 change fee, give you flight credit, or refund you, especially this close to booking. I would not touch this airline with a 10 foot pole.

"I wanted to share my recent experience on the BA2814 flight to Egypt on the 12th of January, return 19th January 2024. As a regular BA traveler, I have occasionally flown business class in the past, and I must express my surprise at the level of service we received despite paying a considerable amount extra for our upgrades.

Despite multiple attempts to get the crew's attention for beverages, my requests were ignored. On an early morning flight, there was no offer of tea or coffee, and our meals came with jam and butter but no croissants. When I asked one of the flight attendants for one, she provided it without an apology for the initial omission. However, when I requested another for my friend, I was informed that none were left.

Throughout the flight, my attempts to get the crew’s attention were often met with them talking amongst themselves or engaging with other customers, seemingly avoiding eye contact even after pressing the blue attendant button.

If this is the standard service in business class, I may have to reconsider my choice of airline for future bookings. The duty-free service, in particular, felt rushed, and the attendant appeared uninterested in whether we placed an order or not.

I hope my feedback helps in maintaining the high standards BA is known for considering we have several other flights booked, this experience is unacceptable and only seems to happen with Gatwick crew. 

The lounge on the way back was disorganised, we got there at 2:20, the system was down owing to us waiting 15 minutes to get through.

There is a certain level of expectation when travelling business class, none of which has been met. In addition there was only 1 toilet in the lounge for women. You were once the UK’s number one airline and from what I experienced I understand why it has been lost, how does BA maintain quality control?

I was flying to a family wedding in South Africa. A long planned and saved for holiday that turned into a nightmare. First flight had such a long delay we missed connecting flight and had to stay overnight in London. Given £10 food voucher but every place was shut by the time we arrived.
I was given a stand by ticket for a late evening flight the next day but no guarantee of a seat on the plane. Spent the morning trying to get an alternative flight  which eventually I did and another £10 food voucher.
On arrival at Cape Town no luggage. Missed Safari pick up and had to book into a hotel.
Then on second day of holiday I ripped tendons in my leg needed hospital treatment and as a result had to fly home for additional treatment. Could not contact BA to change return flight it was impossible and had to book an alternative with Qatar.
Although for some completely random reason I did get notification early January to tell me that my return flight from Cape Town will now be on the 31st January. Great news as I am in Scotland.

 Since September I have  e-mailed, written and best of all spent a days  trying  to call them only to be told on the one occasion I did get through that they are too busy to take my call and call back later.

"Dear all.
I just want to warn everyone of the worst customer service experience ever! it really looks like British airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them.

Last week we called British Airways to make a reservation for the family.  At the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from American Express.  The representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact American Express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made.  The conversation was recorded by British Airways and could be checked. We immediately called AMEX (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500K miles.  AMEX clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible.  We said that it was fine since we had checked previously with British Airways.  We then called British Airways immediately to make our reservation to Miami.  They confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to Miami) and that we could not use the miles.  We explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears.  We called the German office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called UK customer service which was just as unhelpful.   No manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and gotten the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status).  At the end British Airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to Miami.  With this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business.

 I want to explain also all the caos in between each conversation. 
 Every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold again I have 2 days of waiting and talking with British over 2 hours each day,  we  Where on the line for over 45 minutes, each time, then we  got transferred to the supervisor in duty his name Marco  N526304 by the way a person that should not be a supervisor he lied to us 4 times, every time he told us he will return the call to us and never did, first time he said that after 1 hour he will call us , after 2 hours we call and an agent told us ohhh he is in a supervisor meeting will return your call in the morning next day .... at 3 pm next day , no one from British had contacted us , so we call to speak with Marco, they told us he couldnt take our call as he was having lunch, if we want to wait it will be 7 minutes of waiting ...we said yes we wait ...7 minutes, it turn up that  again it was in 45 minutes only  waiting , he got the phone after that and again told us he will recall us  in 4 hours ...6 hours later no call from Marco so we call again and ask to speak with him again we waited for another  40 minutes or longer just waiting time plus 1 hour each time of conversation. then we where told by the lady agent to hang the phone as I was too long on the phone and she had other customers ?????. HELLOOO and we are not customers ???. 
I told her, I will not hang the phone until I had a solution for the problem they created for us. So they transfer me to another supervisor Gabriel that try to help at least he answer the phone and give us some ilogical explanations but he faced the music.
If from the beggining British had told us ....look be careful this is peak season we only have 6 seats for this dates and for the full month of July .....we would never transfer 500k miles to them that we can not use.  
we did all the miles transfer in 30 minutes not even 1 hour.

Be very careful this is by far the worst customer service ever, if my miles where not tied to them I will NEVER use British airway again and will advice if you are considering to use their flights be careful.

"Check-in and Boarding all straightforward but a VERY long walk to the departure gate. BA's premium economy seating on our A.380, registration G-XLEH, is excellent with a good width and legroom. The seat side locker at the window seat is capacious.

Food was poor. Dinner - couscous was very dry as was the Malay chicken curry. No tea or coffee was served after the meal. Breakfast (full English) sealed very tight and difficult to open. No coffee or tea served and we had to go and get it!
IFE was poor. My wife's screen (Seat 65B) had to be resent twice and would only operate through the hand set - touch screen wouldn't work.

Terrible was my experience. BA have become the Ryan Air of long-haul travel, riding on their previous good name and reputation. 
We were delayed for 5hrs at the terminal, where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal - with no additional drinks offered. The charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). The in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. 
The food was atrocious  - we flew BA LHR-HongKong and return and Cathay HK-Australia return and the comparison was vast. We were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with Cathay. 
Our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in Hong Kong and when we arrived into London, one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable. 
The only redeeming part was the crew on our return flight were amazing. Severine was an angle and helped make the journey more pleasant for my kids.",1.0,London,Hong Kong,International,December 2023,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0

"Having booked a Caribbean holiday with British Airways to Tobago, I was slightly concerned when I read the reviews on here before we went. Well, we have just returned from a fabulous week in Tobago and both flights were with BA on a 777 in economy. Can I just say that everything was faultless, all on time, friendly and courteous staff (who really went out of their way for people with medical needs). So much food, drinks, soft or alcoholic and a chocolate ice cream and an excellent choice of movies. (what's all the fuss about Barbie?). Granted we did pay a little extra to get 2 seats on their own right at the back, 43 going and 42 coming back and that was well worth the extra money. Infact the flight back today was 25 minutes early and the cabin staff did well to get breakfast out on time. (The only negative was that the wrap for breakfast was not to my liking but each to their own). All flights very smooth as well. ( we had to stop in St Lucia on both trips which was no hassle as you stay on the plane). Will definitely use BA again.",5.0,London,Tobago,International,January 2024,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
"I haven’t even been on my flight yet but I’m never flying BA again. I booked my trip to South Africa with a travel agent and I opted for the Edinburgh - London BA flight then the London - Johannesburg Virgin flight. I needed to add baggage to the flights but I can’t add checked baggage for my BA flight! The option to do so is unavailable online and on my 1st call with BA they told me Virgin had to add it for them because they are providing the long haul portion of the journey. So I called them and they told me no it is BA. I reach out to my travel agent and he contacted BA and was told “Yes that’s no problem to add baggage just get her to call us with payment”. I get off the phone to him and straight to BA to be told no it’s impossible to add baggage for your flight just do it at the airport. I would do that but the price difference is more than double, £30 each way prior to the flight or £75 each way at the airport! The woman on the phone was rude and not helpful.

"British Airways should be ashamed for the catering that they have provided for the premium economy!!!!
The menu , that was offered in the beginning of our trip, just for decorating purposes lol as you can't select what you want you will be forced to eat what is available. 
I have agreed to eat a fish pie, I am wondering if the pilot himself tried it????? 
For choice of teas or coffee we were offered the ' builders ' tea and ' builders ' coffee, which you can usually get from the cheep burner van on the side of the road lol . 
When I have asked to get me the hot water and the tea bag, I was told that non available.

"My daughter and I went on a trip of a lifetime to New Zealand, we booked all the flights through BA.
It was a code share flight whereby different parts of the journey use different airlines. The Qatar flight was fine, the Cathay Pacific part was fine but the BA final flight from Hong Kong to Heathrow was awful. 
The flight was delayed, to which we have had an apology, the flight took over 15 hours.
We had extra leg room seats which I can only describe as torture. It was an old plane and the seats had no padding on them it was like sitting on a dining room chair for 15 hours.
The cabin staff were not as friendly or welcoming as expected and to be frank a couple of them were quite rude and dismissive.
Food was served, to which I was woken for, the food was fine.
After may be 3-4 hours the cabin lights were turned off and that was it, we saw just may be 5 or 6 staff rush through the cabin, by the time you saw them they were gone.
We were not told we could go to the rear of the plane to get water etc.
After may be 9 hours lights were turned on. Water was bought round a very welcome site.
About 2 hours before we were due to land breakfast was bought round, which was nice.
Not once on this flight did any crew come round asking for rubbish.
I just wonder what they do for the 9 hours you don’t see them, maybe sleep but surely someone should be around to help passengers.
In all the flights we had on this trip BA were certainly the worse and we will not be using them again, they were not the cheapest either.

"I’m writing this review but nothing will change because I’m not convinced that BA care about their passengers . 
Reading the reviews it’s not just economy passengers complaining but business , premium economy and club class .
Check in and timing of flights were fine but as for cabin service comfort etc it was shambolic. Food was served whenever and it was really awful . 
I can get over the food but the seats were so uncomfortable . I think there was 18ins between our seats and the seat in front and they were so uncomfortable. They hardly recline at all and they are so narrow and squashy that it is premium discomfort . I felt the metal of the seat was sticking into my bottom. The whole flight was a nightmare I know how sardines feel in their tin . Somebody has said in reviews that different seats are different sizes well if that’s the case all I can say is 52 d and e must be child seats !

"I created my Tripadvisor account to review this and trust me, I have a lot of other things to do at this point. 

British Airways is the *worst*, sorry did I say *worst*, yes it is the WORST airlines I have experienced since I have started travelling by Air almost 15 years ago and trust me I have taken a lot, a lot of flights from a lot of different Airlines. 

One of the worst customer service. They overbooked the flight and the way they talk appears that they are doing you a favour (while you are paid for the service). They hand me a '4 GBP' voucher from the standby desk, as if I am a beggar or something of that sort. 

They mention that they overbook such that as many people can fly as their choice and to penalise no shows. Oh Boy, have you forgotten that people have priority flights and if they don't catch their flights then there will be many consequences. Such a ridiculous logic to justify your profit???? Really????

Try to learn a thing or two from Singapore Airlines and lose your false sense of pride. You really should start learning things from Asia. 

Never ever will use British Airways in my life and would certainly strongly discourage for anyone to use it at all. 

Sean Doyle: You better stop posting pinned tweet of getting promoted and see what's really happening to your clients. Nobody cares about your tweets but your service and attitude makes a difference and says a lot.

"Wow, where to start!  Paid £3k for a mini break for 2 to New York.  Problem after problem encountered and their customer service is diabolical!  BA was once an upmarket airline, now I’d rather fly with anyone other than them after this experience.  

Firstly there was a delay in take off, then my luggage went missing, it hadn’t been on my plane at all, it ended up in Boston when I was in NYC.  Had no luggage until the next day which was very stressful, meaning no toiletries, sleepwear or clothing.  Very concerning to learn there are unaccompanied luggage on any aircraft!! . The plane there was really grotty and the toilets were filthy dirty.  
The flight home was worse.  No cabin luggage space for coats due to people bringing large suitcases on board that hardly fit into overhead lockers.  Broken tv and charging points in headrest.  Hardly any refreshments offered during flight.  Arrived on time to London but missed connecting flight to Newcastle due to sitting on tarmac over an hour waiting for steps and personnel to get us off plane as the walkway failed.  Went to customer service desk who were unfriendly and harassed as they had queue if complaining customers a mile long.  All they could offer us was train tickets back to Newcastle!!  They had no room to put us on alternative flight.  We had to trawl our luggage across London on public transport at a cost to ourselves, to get to the train station.  Trains were on strike so limited trains available and we weren’t warned about that.  Comes to something when you pay for flights and all BA can offer are train tickets!!  Submitted complaint on my return to be given £23 in compensation to recover cost of toiletries and underwear I purchased through missing suitcase.  That’s it.  No compensation for stress or loss of enjoyment of the mini break, or for their inability to provide an alternative flight, no refund of public transport costs, no sorry, nothing!",1.0,Newcastle upon Tyne,New York City,International,December 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

First off the plane was extremely dirty with chocolate (hoping it was chocolate not something else) smudged all over mine and my children's seats. I had to wipe down all the seats. After we landed I immediately realized I left my work camera with it's bag in the airplane overhead cabin. They would not let me back on the plane for security reasons so I went to The British Airways team on ground & they refused to contact cabin crew only until we threw up a massive fuss then the manager reluctantly agreed which by that point cabin crew had disembarked. Now it's been over 3 weeks with no sign of my camera so it is assumed stolen. I have complained to British Airways and all I get is an automated/generic response to keep checking with Lost Property.

"I travelled 1st Class from Mexico City to London Heathrow using Avios.

The flight was delayed because the pilots were late getting to the aircraft, because of traffic (weird how all the other crew and all the passengers judged the times appropriately. and navigated rush hour Mexico City correctly, and got to the airport on time, but ironically the captain and co pilot, didn't allow themselves enough time!?)  

Since covid I have travelled much less than previously, and therefore I seem to be more focussed and aware of the changes in service received onboard flights. BA has undoubtably declined, their crew are polite but less able, service delivery is now mediocre at best, the food less interesting and poorly presented, and in some cases of poor quality - and too many choices are not available! 

We sat on the tarmac for longer than expected, and in this time, in a cabin of just 8 passengers, the crew did not offer me a drink, or champagne, until the very last minute. A premier Krug champagne was offered on the menu, but the crew were serving monopole blue top, discreetly keeping the bottle in the galley, out of view.  

I pulled out the blanket, and it was old, tatty, worn and badly marked.

The menu looked quite nice, but when my order was taken, half of the options were unavailable, and after takeoff, the service was sooooooo slow, because it seemed the crew were giving all their attention to the 2 passengers in front off me, who were  on their main course by the time anything was offered to me. Therefore, I declined dinner when it was eventually offered, and asked for a hot chocolate and brandy. But after much scurrying around, the cabin attendant informed me that they had no brandy........

I did hear the crew discussing between themselves that they had limited equipment, linen and table-ware, and only had 2 table tablecloths and napkins, to serve breakfast to 8 passengers, and dishes were missing. Having not eaten dinner, I was ready for breakfast, the table cloth was so creased and screwed up, that it would have been better not to have used it. The fruit was actually very nice and perfectly ripe, and the muesli was good too - the 'fresh' juice was out of a supermarket, branded carton, and the cooked element was simply unpleasant, and close to inedible!  

As I already mentioned, I flew using avois miles, accrued from making many international flights for work and pleasure prior to Covid. However, If I had paid the £8,000.00 for this flight I would have been completely distraught!

Nothing stacked up, the price charged does not even begin to equate to the product being sold, or the service being provided.

To make things even worse, when we arrived to Heathrow, it took 2.5 hours for me to retrieve my baggage, during this time, BA's handling agents were pathetic with their actions, no announcements were made until passengers became so irate that something had to be said/done, even then, announcements gave the wrong flight details, and directed passengers to the wrong luggage belt! It was an observant passenger who realised our luggage was being delivered to another belt!

Extremely disappointed. Plane was old dated and dirty. An old b777 200.  Seat was uncomfortable. Toilets very dirty. Did not cater for my allergies. Gluten and lactose free. The child next to me had an had an egg allergy and they give him egg. They are very lax and dangerous with allergies. Service on board was very slow. They would be a very last resort for me. My window and pillow was dirty that the gave me. Clearly had jusy been reused. Air China was a much better experience. Their a320's are also old and a bit dirty.

"On 10th of December i and my wife took a connection flight from larnaca airport to Toronto Pearson airport  via Heathrow.  The flight from Larnaca to Heathrow lasted around 4 hours and 45 ,minutes ( very good flight and the crew was very polite 
) and after passing the security control at Heathrow airport and waiting for 6 hours at the airport with boarded our flight to Toronto Pearson. 
The airplane was a boing787 , as i was travelling economy i chose to sit exit row and particularly at seat 30A and my wife on seat 30B. Although the seat at 30B was a normal one with good width space , the seat  30A was half the width of the other 2 seats on the row and thus very uncomfortable making the trip which lasted almost 7 hours 30 minutes. very difficult.  
So  my suggestion if anyone has the choice of choosing his/her seat on a flight with this particular airplane to avoid it or place a child in that seat.
Other than that the flight was great so as the crew which was very polite and pleasant.
On the way back on the 28th of December the aircraft was a Boing 777, i chose to sit at seat 31A which was again exit row, seat which was great and very comfortable.
On the 2nd part of my return to Larnaca from Heathrow Airport the aircraft used was an AirBus A321 neo. On boarding the plane i found out that they canged my seat and after asking bout it (i did not wanted to be separated from my wife) they explained me that the seat was missing the food tray that's why they moved me to another seat.

"Wednesday 3rd January we were travelling on board British Airways Flight BA0835 from Dublin to Heathrow London.

We were scheduled to depart at 13.00 and arriving at 14.30, a ninety minute flight. At about 11.30 the information board indicate that there would be a fifty minute delay to our departure, there was no mention of this when we checked in.

Finally we commenced boarding at 13.30, which was thirty minutes after we should have taken off. We walked the short distance from the terminal to the aircraft, boarding by steps at the front and rear. The wind whisted through the cabin, it was so very cold in the cabin with both doors open. Thankfully boarding was complete at 13.48 and the doors closed. The aircraft started moving at 13.58 and airborne at 14.10 which was seventy minutes later than scheduled.
The Captain made an announcement, welcoming us on board and apologised for the delay, this was due the delay of the incoming flight from Rome, of over fifty minutes. He also advised that the flight time would be around fifty minutes.

We were travelling in the Europe Class Cabin, despite this the legroom was a bit miserly. We did book this service for the additional space, there was no benefit apart from nobody sitting in the middle row, three seats between two of us.

We were not long in the air when we were offered afternoon tea, some finger sandwiches and a warm scone with cream, no thanks, did not really fancy it. Instead we had a drink from the bar.

The Captain made a further announcement that there was twenty-five minutes of the flight remaining and he had commenced the descent into Dublin.

We landed softly at 14.58, just short of half an hour late. It took a further eighteen minutes for the aircraft to reach the Terminal, ground crew were being chased up to handle the plane's arrival.

To add insult to injury it took an additional forty minutes for our cases to be received in to the  baggage hall.",2.0,Dublin,London,Europe,January 2024,2.0,3.0,N/A,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0

Despite the challenging communication aspect, I must acknowledge the consistently pleasant demeanor of the staff. However, the difficulty in reaching someone directly has been a significant hurdle.

"In August, I embarked on a round-trip business class journey with British Airways from Romania to the USA. The outbound journey was without incident, but the return trip was where issues arose. The flight back to Europe was delayed by nearly 2 hours, causing me to miss my connecting flight. The alternative flight offered was over 14 hours later the same day, which was unacceptable. I found a different flight with another airline departing within an hour and was assured by British Airways that I would be refunded upon sending them the receipt.

Upon returning home, I contacted British Airways through email and their complaint system, but for a month, there was no response. When I finally reached them by phone, the customer service was dismissive and insisted I email them, despite my explaining their lack of response. After 2 more months of continuous emailing, they finally replied, denying any obligation to compensate. Persistently, I insisted on a refund for the flight I missed due to their delay. After 4 months, they conceded but refunded a mere 5 euros, claiming it was the cost of the connecting flight – a business class flight, no less. This not only felt insulting but also demeaning.

The ordeal with British Airways was frustrating and disappointing. The lack of timely and effective communication, poor customer service, and the dismissive manner in handling my refund were starkly unprofessional. The negligible refund felt like a slap in the face after the inconvenience they caused. Due to this experience, I am considering legal action for compensation and moral damages.

"Saturday 30th December we were travelling to Dublin from Heathrow Terminal 5 on board British Airways Flight BA0838.

We were due to depart at 12.10 and arriving at 13.40, a scheduled flight time of ninety minutes.

Boarding was due to commence at 11.30, it started a few minutes late at 11.42 and  was completed by 12.13, when the doors closed.

Five minutes later the aircraft pushed back from the terminal.

We booked our seats, in Club Europe Class using our Avios reward points. We were seated in row 2, we had three seats between us, the middle one was converted into a table.

The Captain welcomed us on board and advised that we would be taking off along the west runway which could take 15 to 25 minutes to take off depending on number of other aircraft in front of us. He also informed us that flight time would be 50 minutes, once airborne. We we were finally in the air at 12.42 a good bit later than expected 

As we were in the Europe Class Cabin we were offered lunch the choice of smoked salmon or veg salad, we opted for one of each.

The salmon dish was really tasty and plenty of it. Sadly the veg dish was a bit disappointing, it comprised of what looked like Bulgur wheat sitting on a bed of green sauce with strips of roast veg, rather bland. The bread rolls were warm, crusty and tasty, the chocolate dessert was delicious.

We were also served drinks from the bar at the same time as the food.

A few days before departure we ordered and paid for our duty free purchases, these were brought to our seats once we were on board. This avoided the hustle and bustle on the busy shops in the Terminal.

We landed at 13.28, which was twelve minutes earlier than scheduled, which is always good news.

Can't fault the flight, comfortable, spacious, Cabin Crew were friendly and attentive and arrived early.  Food is unnecessary on such a short flight.

"Another BA flight and another bad experience! When will this end??

I was on the BA173 from LHR to JFK on the 4th of January, in business class, which cost me a little fortune £7,697.59.

All went OK during the flight but as soon as I landed at JFK, my name was called via the loud speaker, asking me to see a BA representative.

After passport control, I was met by and unfriendly and slightly rude woman that told me that my suitcase had not made into JFK.

I was shocked but she did not really care, which seems to be the BA attitude across the globe!

Here's a list of questions I have for BA:

1) How is it possible that a business class suitcase had been left behind?

2) How is it possible that paying a premium does not guarantee a minimum of customer service?

4) How is it possible that the BA representative was so careless that all my details were wrong on the form?

5) How is it possible that the US BA call centre operator could not speak English properly, and got the address and phone number wrong? Took me multiple calls to get everything right!

"THE INITIAL PROBLEM
I booked with British Airways from London Gatwick to St Martin via Antigua. At Gatwick I checked in and BA checked my luggage through to St Martin. At Antigua, the check in desk told me that BA had not confirmed my flight so I would need to buy another ticket IN CASH within the next 10 minutes.

"Worst airline experience we had with British airways. I wish I had known earlier. I was travelling with my mom who is 65 year of age. Instead of landing on LHR they made us land at London Gatwick Airport. We were forced to sit in flight for 4 hrs. We missed our connecting flight to USA. That is a whole different trauma we faced. Anyways British airways had  no curtesy to apologize. The staff was rude on asking how we will reach our final destination. After 4 hrs when they flew back to Heathrow , we were handed over 10 pound compensation written on a page (to be used within that day and only with their partner stores. Surely now that you have missed your flight you have time to find those partner stores and spend 10 pound ). While returning , we had no option other than to fly with them since they were not returning us even a single penny . (This information also we got after multiple calls and emails for days to them). At return again delayed at London for hours and hours. No explanation, no apology. I do not even want to explain the condition of my mother while making this trip. An elderly person is not capable for going through these unnecessary hassles over an already long journey. 
 To end the trip further better, they broke my luggage. Now I can not use it any more. Thanks to all the terms and conditions they secretly put in place which doesn't allow me to challenge them, ask for a compensation or an apology. So lesson learned, never travelling with them anymore.  I suggest you do not either.",1.0,Dubai,London,International,October 2023,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0

"Terrible elitist treatment from BA on my return flight from BA. Advised on my day of travel that my flight was cancelled and I was booked onto a flight 4hrs later leaving JFK at 11.30pm. Also my connection flight to Glasgow was now changed to an Edinburgh flight! When I arrived at JFK I saw that my original flight was in fact boarding on time? When I queried this with the BA rep they advised it was my Glasgow connection that had been cancelled but the London Operations had cancelled the complete booking! I had also booked two side seats on my flight but was now moved to 2 middle row seats. This whole escapade was stressful and inconvenient due to my car being in Glasgow and BA returning me to Edinburgh! When I submitted my claim for compensation I was told that as the cancellation was due to lack of air space I wasn’t entitled to any compensation, goodwill or otherwise. I reminded them that they had failed to return me to my point of departure and dropped me in a different city, they again showed their arrogance and repeated the cancellation reason and not being their fault. Obviously the fault is mine for presuming BA were a company that cared about their customers and are too arrogant to realise that customers have a choice. I would have expected some sort of goodwill recognition given my cost of the flights (Premium Economy), late notification of cancellation and total inconvenience of traveling from the wrong city to get home.

"After a long flight from Miami to London Heathrow we found out our connecting flight to Manchester had been cancelled for no apparent reason, no problem say BA well book you on the next available flight, (we should of left Heathrow at 8am for the short flight to Manchester).
They booked us on the next flight at 6pm, my husband decided to hire a car and drive us back to Manchester airport to get our car, en route we had another text to say the re-booked flight had been cancelled as well, quite happy with ourselves for not waiting around all day to wait for a flight that was to be cancelled we thought at least we’ll be refunded.
Not the case we submitted our claim 17th October and still haven’t received a penny of our cancelled flight let alone compensation which has also been denied due to weather (flights continued all the rest of that day with other airlines, we checked). 
The utter chaos at the BA desk to inform the very rude women behind the desk 
that we intended to make our own way home - there must of been another 40 poor people in the same situation as us from other flights cancelled. 
I’m shocked to say the least, British Airways was the Jewell in the Crown, I don’t know what’s gone wrong but they seriously need to roll some heads at the top.
My husband travels a lot for work and if a flight is cancelled they are prompt, professional and courteous with their customers and refunded flights are normally paid in a couple of weeks if that. 
I honestly can’t get over how poor they are, you go round in circles if you ring and if you email with the link given they don’t reply.

After repeated emails I finally get an email saying I will be refunded the difference. That was months ago and now the case is closed and again no one will help. I will never ever fly with BA again.

Not so lucky to be one of 8 passengers whose seat DID NOT RECLINE, BROKEN.  Boeing 777 that is as tired as BA.  It took a long time for the lead flight attendant to attempt to fix the seat to no avail  The food tray arrived and the food was WET and COLD.  Shocking, disgusting.  To add insult to injury the overwhelmed crew took one and half hours to clear the nasty meal trays in the cabin.  The plane condition was so used and the worst part was the bathroom with a wet floor that was never attended to despite the crew being alerted to the unsanitary wet floor restroom.  The crew was understaffed and not enjoying their job.  Not rude but unengaged.  As an Executive Platinum/Emerald member I wrote to BA.  My client purchased Premium Economy and I requested they be reimbursed for the class of service as main cabin would have been more comfortable.  The pathetic executive response reflects perfectly BA's faltering customer service.

Ofcourse, noone from BA dared appear, they left it to hassled DNATA ground agents. The fun didn't end there.

Ofcourse, the email or SMS was never received so was stuck. Felt really sorry for the many families with young kids just starting their holiday whom BA had comprehensively stiffed. I eventually filed a complaint and then called the UK BA number which I was told to call for further info. They told me they had no information, but to call the ground agent in Dubai.

"British Airways – Very Disappointing 

What a dreadful experience. My wife and I splashed out on a first-class flight to Houston Texas to celebrate our 35th Wedding Anniversary. We paid for business class coming back, so what went wrong, in order

1. Having to pay extra for a guaranteed seat next to each other when paying over £2500 for business class flights. Its a disgrace. This is how a budget airline would act.

2. After paying this extra money, our carefully chosen seats get changed to less desirable seats a couple of months before we fly due to British Airways changing size of plane.

3. Just a few hours after checking in for our first-class flight out, 20 hours before we fly, my wife and I receive a text saying flight is now cancelled. We've had this trip booked for 10 months and it gets cancelled less than 24hours before we fly. The disappointment was extremely stressful and upsetting and beyond belief. 

4. Concorde Lounge. Full English breakfast poor and very dry and gave the impression it had been under the hot plate for a while. 

5. Again, our carefully chosen seats of sitting next to each other at the front now get changed to sitting behind each other.

6. Service in first class was lovely but we were not taken to our seat as all the information suggests.

7. My wife was a little embarrassed as she had to ask for her vanity kit which had been forgotten. (Please note, staff on both trips were lovely but sometimes its the little things that just need to improve) 

8. New flights offered but now we must fly to Dallas and then get internal flight to Houston. We specifically booked a direct flight for a reason.

9. Airport times now change to approx. 2 hours earlier and arriving some 2 -3 hours later at the other end. Bearing in mind this is all very last minute the inconvenience of having to rearrange transport at both ends, all British Airways seemed to be concerned about is that we got to our destination under 3 hours later than expected. Yes they got us there on the same day and under 3 hours later than was expected, full marks to them, I don’t have a problem with that but it’s the arrogance and attitude regarding all the other inconvenience we had to go through which they don’t seem to want to recognise. 

We have been offered £200 which is somewhere in the region of what we had to pay to sit next to each other in business class and even these got changed.

Being British you really want to believe British Airways would be a trustworthy, compassionate company that would be a pleasure to use. Quite frankly, they were a bit of a disgrace.

They are currently promoting that they want to get back to being one of the best airlines in the world but my god have they got a way to go.

"I flew to Jamaica on flight BA2263. The flight Was 3 hours late and then when we got there we had to sit in the aircraft for half an hour. They said it was because of weight issues. Our luggage was never loaded aboard even though we paid extra. No one said any of this to us and when we arrived there was no 1 that you could speak to or anyone at all to give you any information. We searched the carousels for 3 hours looking for our luggage. My elderly Uncle was forced to check his medication into the hold. Even though it was in his hand luggage what they said there was no space to put hand luggage. Finally we saw chaos breakout and found out there was some person with a form we could fill in. We managed to do this and they said in 5 days time they might give us our bags. On arriving 5 days later it was total chaos and pandemonium. Because of the way we were treated and everything they did to us my Uncle collapsed several times. When we first got there we nearly had to sleep on the pavement outside the airport because it was 3 AM by the time we had managed to get a form or speak to the 1 person.

"As of writing - we have been sitting on the plane for close to 120 minutes having already been delayed at D14 boarding gate.

No updates for the first hour or so
Lots of passengers with no mental capacity to understand that cramming overhead lockers with multiple large puffy coats is an issue: so the beleaguered air hostesses had to spend hours taking out passengers’ clothing and returning it to them.

An hour after this still no news as to why the huge delay: then an announcement blaming over selling of tickets with in flight luggage capacity was allegedly the cause for the no attempt to take off:

Then we get told the aoreoplane needs mechanical fixing before it is safe to fly.

Two hours later am still sitting here waiting with a recent ‘ oh goody we can take off now ‘ announcement but with yet more failure to act on the promises 

It should have left at 14.50
It  is now 17.09

I make a solemn promise to never ever go near this vile airline again.

Oh almost forgot. On the way out to Amsterdam no online food order showed up either:
the first attempt to ask about it netted a very rude air hostess. 
The second attempt netted a very sweet hostess who promised to get it and then never returned. 

This left me no choice but to ask on the way off the plane;
this netted 3 staff telling me that ‘ you will have been refunded the missing  order’. 

There is nothing worse than the 
wrecking of a trip either side by what is clearly an utterly broken useless airline and BA has done this.

I will never ever fly again with this awful company: my daughter flew 8 times last year on RyanAir and EasyJet last year and not o ce was there a delay.

I am also filled with horror that the plane needed mechanical fixing with an over crowded full aeroplane.

"It has been a very disruptive, emotionally frustrating and physically draining experience travelling with British Airways. First of all, our flights was due to depart at 11.40am, and then at 7am we received an email saying that our flight was cancelled. Fairly enough they rebooked 3 pax out of the 4pax we we were travelling together, with the last one we witch to an Iberia flight with overlay on a different city. Upon arrival to the terminal, the BA customer rep before the check in counter was useless and didn't help us at all. We had to do a queue for more than 45min to get to the till, and over 1h of wait until they manage to sort new boardings for a flight nearly 7h later than the original one we purchased. For a delay on our flight itinerary of more than 10h, the only retribution we got was a £10 voucher per person. There was not even a proper reason behind our flight cancellation and the wait in the airport is simply awful. To be honest, I've never had an experience like this before using Ryanair or easyJet.

"I have been a participant in the American Express Avios Program for quite some time, and it's safe to say that it has been nothing short of a financial black hole. The exorbitant annual fee of over £200 is an absolute joke, especially considering the dismal partnership with British Airways that accompanies it.

One of the major grievances I have with this program is the companion voucher that supposedly adds value. However, it's more of a tease than a benefit. Despite diligently checking the website for available flights for months, I find myself unable to utilize the voucher before its June expiration. It's like having a golden ticket with no access to the chocolate factory.

The limited flight options available are a slap in the face. Even when flights do miraculously appear, the prices are indistinguishable from what you can easily find on Google Flights. The supposed partnership with British Airways is a farce, offering no real advantage over budget airlines like Ryanair.

Navigating the program's website is a Herculean task. It's convoluted, counterintuitive, and an overall nightmare to use. Seeking assistance from customer service proved to be a futile exercise. Hours spent on the phone with both American Express and BA resulted in absolute incompetence and zero solutions. It's as if their aim is to drive customers to the brink of insanity.

Booking a business class ticket, touted as a luxury experience, was a grave mistake. The reality? A regular chair with an empty seat in the middle – hardly a business class offering. Access to the lounge, another so-called perk, was abruptly cut short during a flight delay, leaving us stranded in a crowded airport. The whole experience was a far cry from the promised premium service.

Now, with two companion vouchers set to expire before I can even use them, the program's flaws become even more glaring. The lack of available flights during peak months for a school teacher like myself, July and August, renders the entire program utterly pointless.

Attempting to leave the program only adds insult to injury. They casually inform you that you will receive nothing for the unused companion voucher and Avios points. It's a slap in the face for those who invested time and money into this debacle.

To be fair, using Avios for hotels seems to be the only redeeming aspect of the program. However, this solitary positive cannot salvage the sinking ship that is the American Express Avios Program. This experience has not only soured my opinion of British Airways but has also left me despising anything associated with this abysmal program. The service is abysmal, and the lack of solutions from customer service is a testament to the utter failure of this ill-conceived program. Save your money and sanity – steer clear of the American Express Avios Program.",1.0,London,San Jose,International,April 2023,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,1.0,N/A,N/A,N/A

"BA let us down once again, although, they did get us home eventually. We have returned late last night from a wonderful trip to Tenerife.

I was not pleased, I rang BA.

"One of the worst airlines to fly long haul. I've been disappointed on 2 separate occasions when flying to US this year. Earlier this year they lost my luggage and could not locate it.

On the day of my flight I get text in morning that my flight is cancelled. I was only able to get a new flight 5 days later. I tried to get refunds for the costs associated rebooking later flights and BA kept rejecting claims. 

Worse the new flight for BA ( all legs were delayed ) and the connecting flight the plane had to be swapped. 

I finally arrive into amman absolutely wiped out only to find my bag missed the connection.  I was in Jordan for only one day before flying to Cyprus.

"This may take a while. Boarded flight on time, only to sit on plane, at gate, for 2:10. This caused us to miss our connection in London.

We had to wait in a long line to get our plane ticket but that person directed us elsewhere to get vouchers for hotel, shuttle, dinner, breakfast and refreshments. That took another 50 minutes. The refreshment voucher was only good for the day, and we would have had to go back into a security line to get to the restaurants. Not happening. When the shuttle took us to our airport hotel, the hotel (Renaissance Bonvoy) directed us to a location to get our room key. That line was another long one with just one person serving all of us. We finally got checked in, went to the hotel restaurant. Only offering was a “buffet” with dark meat chicken quarters, rice, potatoes and mixed veggies. And limited salad fixings. Hardly a “buffet” but no menu option available. We asked for ice teas and they said we had to go out of the restaurant to the hotel bar to get anything but water. I went to the bar and was told the voucher for the meal did not include drinks. Seriously. Went back to the table to discover the water was self-serve from another room in the restaurant.

"British airways canceled two of my flights on Dec. 21st. When I got in touch with them to know why and what my options were to return back home, they told me they can rebook one of the flights, but did not have anymore flights from Europe to USA past noon, so I would have to wait until the next day. I agreed to do all the flights on the 22nd, missed a day at work and involuntarily had to stay an extra day in Europe. For some reason, they had me go from London to Germany, from Germany back to London. I was already in London, so I asked multiple times if I could just catch my flight back home from London since I was already there. They said no. I proceeded with the flight itineraries and the flight from Germany to London was delayed causing me to miss my flight from London to USA.

After that, I called customer service again to try to get some type of compensation due to all the inconveniences, the agent offered me better seats for the remainder of my flights, but upon checking-in my seats were the worst of the worst.

We sent them a medical note from his doctor saying he is unfit to travel due to potential heart failure and needs to have heart surgery as soon as possible, and the operator totally dismissed it. They said only thing they can do is change the travel date within a year. Heart surgery recovery takes months and it's highly unlikely that he will be able to travel within the year, meaning he would lose his ticket and money!

"BA customer service is nonexistent, bag did not arrive at Atlanta airport after flying from Newcastle with connecting flight in Heathrow to Atlanta.

Bag did arrive at Atlanta 2 days later and label created for FedEx to deliver which never happened and case closed by BA because they created a label not on delivery of bag. There performance was more important that repatriate me with my bag, which i never received.
Second attempt by BA to get my bag made on day 5 of trip with FedEx overnight but true to form bag ever arrived, day 6 a phone call from Atlanta airport to inform me the bag didn't go and they couldn't guarantee me that bag would arrive so bag left at airport until my return flight 2 days later.

"Booked on flight from Manchester to Johannesburg via Heathrow. First flight cancelled a few hours before, said due to weather in Heathrow but weather was fine and other flights going). Booked on one 2 hours later which meant over 2 hour layover at Heathrow so still fine. That was then delayed so we missed our connection. At Heathrow, told to see customer service where we queued for over 3 hours to talk to a rep. There was no prioritisation for people who could have got another flight (including us), no communication, just told to stand in queue. So didn’t make another flight, we were shattered by then and just wanted to sleep. So in a hotel for the night and left a day late. Werent allowed to get our bags overnight however which I think is out of order. Just means that someone can’t be othered to go and get it. Wasn’t happy leaving it in the airport for the night. 
When we did get on our flight, the plane was ok but the food was terrible, never had food that bad on an international flight, same on the way back, couldn’t eat it. 
 I cannot fault BA for putting us in a decent hotel and giving us food vouchers but there system at Heathrow and making us wait for hours stood up in a queue was unacceptable.

"Our original flight was cancelled (BA826 - 9.00PM) and we were rescheduled for a flight the next morning. We asked a customer service agent who told us to still check our bags in and they would be put on our new flight (BA832 - 6.55AM). We checked our bags in, as suggested to us. No accommodations were made for us - we called British Airways customer service line to be informed that we could receive hotel vouchers as our flight was rescheduled to the following morning. Once I asked a customer service agent in the airport, I was informed that hotel vouchers were no longer in use and we would have to pay for a hotel and reclaim our expenses. At the end of a holiday, the last thing expected is to have to pay for further accommodation - people do not have money to spend last minute. Shelter is a fundamental right, one which your company failed to provide for us. Quite irresponsible of a leading airline. 
Our rescheduled flight was then cancelled (BA832 - 6.55AM). At this point, we were rescheduled to a flight in London City Airport (BA464 - 13.40). Not only was this our second flight that was cancelled, but we were then rescheduled to a completely different airport. We were informed of this cancellation via the departures board at 4.17am. This was after staying in the airport overnight.  
After waiting in line to speak with a customer service agent, we were told we would need to reclaim our luggage downstairs at baggage reclaim. We proceeded to wait until 5.00am, as instructed, for baggage reclaim to open. Once opened the manager of baggage enquiries in Heathrow, Terminal 5 informed us to wait in line, speak with his colleague and we would get our bags returned to us. His colleague was very helpful - she took our information down, informed us to wait and that someone would shortly accompany us into the baggage room to collect our luggage. She said this would be after 5.30am when the person started their shift. At 6.03am, she approached us to apologise for the delay and informed us that it may be after 7.00am before we could reclaim our bags. We, along with several other members of the public, waited for hours to collect our baggage. At 8.30, I approached the desk to request an update, only to be informed that I received the incorrect information at 5.00am and that I would not be receiving my baggage today. I was told I needed to complete a missing baggage form. Myself and my fiancé were outraged at this - we had waited for 2.5 hours to be informed we would not receive our luggage. We requested to discuss our situation with a manager. The manager from terminal 5 baggage enquires was very hostile. Firstly, he accused us of not picking up our bags, implying the fault was ours. Once we explained that he had in fact advised us that morning that we would receive our bags, he continued repeating that we would not be getting our bags, and that we would simply have to fill in the form. He raised his hand in front of our faces to tell us to stop talking so he could speak - repeating the same information. He lacked empathy and did not take any responsibility for his actions. The lack of respect was astounding. 
Myself and my fiancé were exhausted, our flights had been cancelled twice, we were instructed by him that we would not receive our luggage, even though several staff members confirmed it was in the store and they had located both suitcases. Until I enquired, we were not communicated with after 6.00am and then we were berated by the manager when we couldn't collect our bags (that we were advised to check in.) 
We completed the lost baggage form, spoke with a lovely customer service agent, Layla, who was sympathetic to our situation and organized for us to fly from Heathrow so we would not have to travel. Layla also informed us that she could organize for our bags to be put on that flight to ensure we would receive them in Dublin. 
Our flight scheduled for 15.10 was delayed and did not take off until 16.30. Once we arrived in Dublin, we went to collect our baggage, only to find out that they had lost my fiancé's bag. We then needed to make another missing baggage report, in Dublin Airport. 
Overall, our journey, from London to Dublin took over 20 hours and we didn't even receive all of our luggage. We have yet to receive the missing luggage. 
We had our flight cancelled on us twice, rescheduled for a different airport, informed we would not be allowed to collect our bags, and delayed for over 20 hours, all at the hands of British Airways. 

Since this we have filed complaints and claims and have received nothing from British Airways not even a response, it has been 12 weeks since the incident and we have not received any form of apology, or compensation, we have been brushed off and ignored without word every step of the way!",1.0,London,Dublin,Europe,October 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
"Although I arrived at LHR airport well in advance (my flight to ABZ was at 9pm, and I was in LHR around 1pm and I only had with me a backpack and a carry-on bag to take directly on board before entering the security check area, I was stopped in a very rude way by a British Airways agent who asked me for my boarding pass and forced me to send the carry on bag, I said I wanted to take it with me, and she told me that I couldn't because the boarding pass indicated that I belonged to boarding group 4.

I was forced to open the carry-on and transfer a lot of things into my backpack and, obviously, it resulted in huge inconvenience for the reason that I was forced to carry a very full and heavy backpack on my shoulders with back problems.

This British Airways agent displayed deplorable behavior in terms of lack of kindness, collaboration and obviously also implemented discriminatory behavior towards me for the reason that she told me that I had to send the carry-on bag for the reason that I was in group 4, but then later at the gate I could see that there were passengers who belonged to boarding group 6 who had carry-on bags that they were able to take on board.

Furthermore, this British Airways agent always limited herself to stopping only me before I passed the security checks and let everyone else go (this is also discriminatory behavior).

"1st problem, boarding by area. Starting with A, 30 secs later A,B. 30 more secs A to D, 10 secs later E. Result big queue of p#ssed off people. 
Next problem E is right at the back and everyone is boarding from the front. Are you really that thick, everyone is now blocked in A area because some t#rd couldn't figure out boarding E first, then D etc is far more efficient. 
Next problem is utterly unforgivable. Every other airline allows 1 piece of hand luggage of limited size, but you allow 2 and from what I saw those both could be bigger than my normal luggage. Result was once those first few people had boarded the plane there was no more room in the overhead lockers for anything, then there was no room under seats (2 large pieces of hand luggage do not fit under seats) so even if you had 1 piece of normal sized hand luggage it had to go in the hold. Added to this most people also had large thickly insulated jackets (Saltzburg was covered in snow), normally these would be squeezed into the spare space in the lockers but these had to worn (to hot) or somehow squeezed into the leg room.

"Having been fortunate enough to have enjoyed winter holidays in the Caribbean for many years, we have unfortunately watched the steady decline in general standards of British Airways.

Having worked hard during our lives, we feel we should make an effort to afford ourselves Business Class travel in our retirement.   Over 12 of the last 13 years, we have holidayed in St. Lucia in November and Business class travel is only available to this destination with British Airways.   During this time, we have flown in the Boeing 777 aircraft that doesn't seem to have  been upgraded during this time.  The seats are 'tired', you press buttons that don't work and everything appears to be 'second-hand'.  Last year, on our return trip to UK, my wife hadn't got a seat tray.  The flight attendant cheerily explained to her that it had 'Fallen off last week and was going to be replaced soon'.  Furthermore, they had got round the problem by offering a sheet that she could put over her legs  and rest her dinner there.  Being a 'non-complaining type of person, my wife managed this without making a fuss and just got on with it.

Whilst it is true to say we have had dissatisfaction with BA on this flight over the last 5 years, our major gripe is seating.   We do use other airlines to fly to the Middle East and Far East at other times of the year (NOT BA I hasten to add) and are delighted with the quality of everything they offer (QATAR and EMIRATES mostly.   We just book Business Class and take it for granted that we will be seated together - and we are.

British Airways, however, have a cynical attitude to those that don't pay extra to sit together.  By our experiences, they make a point of seating partners as far distant as they can manage, if they haven't paid the extra.  We are pretty sure this happens  - from two examples. 

 Immediately after the Covid panic, we went to St. Lucia and found the Business Class cabin only half-occupied.  BA had placed my wife at Row 6 of Business Class, with an empty seat next to her and I was in Row 2, again with an empty seat next to me.  

 Last year, we were both placed in one of the pairs of (backwards facing) seats in the middle of the cabin.  She was in Row 7 and I was in row 4.  I sat next to a gentleman and we began chatting.  Suddenly, we were distracted by my wife, along with another lady waving at us.  The other lady was his wife.    After talking, the two ladies had deduced that their respective husbands were both seated together in Row 7   It transpired that BA our placed our respective wives together and us, the two husbands together.  If those two examples don't smack of cynicism I don't know what does. 

We generally find the cabin service 'bearable', the food quality just about acceptable but the cabin environment pretty 'shabby.   I remember, years gone by, I felt proud of BA (I was a shareholder then !!).     I am afraid our 'National Carrier' does not deserve that status any more.  The general standards of virtually everything they do falls woefully short of the majority of the World's major airlines and it is difficult to see them regaining their previous good name.  I am afraid I no longer recommend BA if there is an alternative.   Their seating policy just reflects on their general attitude towards their customers, which seems to be to give to the minimum service and extract as much money as they can, penalising those that resist by not paying their premiums.",2.0,St. Lucia,London,International,November 2023,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,2.0

"My family and I took a recent 2 night break to London to take in the festivities.  Our son has autism and as in the case for many with this hidden disability,  travel can be tough on them.  Our trip was going well, until it came to our return flight with BA from Heathrow to Dublin.

We were unable to check in online due to an error with the website, so we ensured we would arrive early to the airport and check in there before any crowds to make things easy on my son.  When we checked in at the assistance desk, we were told that the flight was almost full and therefore we could not all be seated together.  I explained to the check in agent the situation with my son, but she was unable to assist us and told us he would be seated on his own, 15 rows back from us in a middle seat between two strangers....He is only 12 years old!!

Our next step was to try at the gate to see if anything could be done, but once again we were told there was no way of moving anyone around to accommodate him.  By this stage he was in an extremely anxious state and we were left with no option but to move him ourselves to one of our seats and my wife sat alone at the back.  This made things even worse for him as he will only calm when we are both where he can see us.

We were not offered any alternative and needed to get him home.  On top of that, the flight was delayed which did not help.  I contacted BA when we returned home, to receive a 'copy and paste' email which did not even address the issue we had showing a clear lack of compassion from them and made it clear that they did not even truly read our complaint.

"My 16 year old daughter traveled alone. Flight was fine, no problem and they managed not to loose her suitcase which a bonus these days but Heathrow airport experience was something! Before I sent her alone I did my research and made sure that she is allowed to travel alone. Website said yes, 16 year old don’t need parents permission. Bought tickets, smooth. But at the point of online check in it all started - it would not let me check in and get boarding pass online saying her passport needs to be checked at the airport. At the airport tried to self check in and got a ticket to seek assistance. Airport staff had no clue, at first directed us to a long queue at a wrong zone. The queue wasn’t moving so I asked to redirect us. Eventually we found ourselves that they had a special assistance area, here we needed to go according to the ticket from self kiosk. As we came there they told us that we needed boarding pass to be seen. Boom! that’s a circle! Assistant directed us to a special assistance check in queue, but lady at that queue wasn’t happy for us queuing there as it was for people with special needs evidently. At the end I had enough and just forced ourselves. After 30 min wait we got to the desk to be told that as my daughter is 16 they needed a “signed paper”. I disagreed that not - according to their website. BA assistant decided to call flight management, after another 30 listening to how important our call was I asked her to find someone senior as it was getting ridiculous. She snapped at me - “ok then, I will find my manager”. But manager wasn’t anywhere around. She was wandering around desks for next 10 min and managed to get an answer from someone that my daughter was fine to fly alone and no extra documents needed. After that we were given boarding pass and all went fine. Only I ended up with a huge parking bill.

"We flew return from lhr to lax . This airline has definitely gone down.

On return Boarding was chaotic- due to the electric gate people were boarding in group 2 when they were actually group 6.
On both flight Staff were not that friendly, when we asked for a drink flying to lax we were greeted with a stewardess rolling her eyes, we were missed out on drinks with food and on the return flight we were told quite sharply by one air hostess to shut the blind around 20 minutes after take off when we hadn’t had any food yet.

Good: Had an airport hotel and a very early flight, so could check in the bags the night before.  Unfortunately the first desks we were directed to couldn’t take bags due to a broken belt so checked in online and dropped bags at auto bag drop.

Good:  Fast track security was efficient.

Poor:  Quick visit to the lounge.  Poor food on offer, no table service.  Decent range of alcohol for those wishing to drink at 0600.

Boarding: Reasonably efficient for a full flight.  We pushed back a few minutes early.

Flight:  Excellent service throughout, and a breakfast served in club.  What was noticeable was the food in the air was better than the food on the ground in the lounge.

Our return flight on May 8 was cancelled the morning of, and we were re-booked for the next day, but we needed to return that day.  I spoke with the airline, they could not get us home that day, and the airline said that the return trip would be refunded.  We booked a return on United and came home that day.  My refund was $70 total for our cancelled return trip. After numerous communications and hours wasted, BA informed me that the $70 refund was all that I was getting back.

"British Airways is the worst! I would avoid booking with them if at all possible. Their apps don't work at all with the website. Your bookings won't show up no matter what you do. They call it a 'known problem' but never fix it. They are constantly canceling and delaying flights with no consideration for how this affects the customer. Our flight was canceled (why?) and we were booked onto a later flight, then that flight was delayed 14 hours (also no explanation why) which screwed up all our plans for hotels, airport transfers, dinner, and getting there for our daughter's birthday. We had to figure out a solution for ourselves that added an additional layover and 5 hours, but would get us there on time. But guess what! They had to downgrade our seats on part of the flight and the change added 5 hours to our travel day(s). So annoying!

"The staff at BA are lovely however BA's systems are non transparent and will leave you without rights and unable to travel, even after following their procedures for adding special baggage. 

I have called every flight the last 4 months to add special baggage, which in my case requires informing the airline 27 hours before the flight to add a special note to the booking for the staff to read at the airport.  I have followed this on multiple occasions. When calling over multiple days prior to the flight to double and triple check, I find  that the note has NOT been added, I have been informed that it is my own risk of turning up to the airport. 

The staff are advised to add the note there and then, which breaches their own 72 hour rule. 

The result is that the bag may not be allowed on the flight, as the note has not been approved.

I was text messaged 30minutes before the flight was due to depart as I was checking my bags in.

I was exhausted, anxious and upset as there was NO ONE at the Johannesburg BA counter to assist me - I was promised someone would help but no one arrived. I had to pay for another flight to get to Durban. 
Very POOR CUSTOMER SERVICES. I want to be reimbursed for a second flight I had to book at the last second. The BA team at Johannesburg was non existent and didnt get back to me either as promised.

"A family of three, inclusive of their 10-month of baby, were the last to board on our flight from London to New York, on flight BA 185. They boarded and spent roughly 30 minutes running up and down the aisles, passing the baby around and creating major annoyances. The parents tried to store their child ON THE FLOOR of the flight, and even hit the baby when it started crying, as they were bringing her back up to the chair. After 35 minutes of back and forth with the crew, the crew agreed to let the parents place the 10-month old baby in bassinet, but in a different row from us, for the flight after take off and before landing. Throughout all of this, the wife is sitting looking aimlessly at her screen and not engaging with anyone, while the husband is being critical of everyone, screaming loudly, and acting arrogantly towards the flight staff.

As the cabin is being prepared for take off, the husband, who is sitting next to me, turned and in a very alarming and manipulative way said: It is going to be better for you to switch seats. Because I didn’t have a first class or business ticket (due to lack of inventory), I resorted to paying extra money to reserve my seat. Hearing the husband ask me to switch from my aisle seat to the interior middle, and be in between the husband, wife, and 10-month old baby seemed like a joke, and I respectfully told him I’d like to remain in the seat that I was assigned. For the next 3 hours, the couple is loudly talking with each other. They had no concept of talking quietly as to not disturb their fellow passengers, and the stewardesses were not helpful in asking them to settle down. In addition to the loud conversations, the guests had no concept of personal space. The husband elbowed me countless times, slept on me, put his clothing on me, and even used the area under the seat in front of ME to put his feet.

At a point during the flight, the baby woke up and began screaming. The wife was fixated on the map in her entertainment console and outwardly ignored the screaming baby while the husband was in the bathroom. Multiple passengers began looking around, trying to locate the parents to come sooth their child who is now screaming, as a few minutes had passed, when the father jumped out of the bathroom and began soothing the child again. The wife remained unbothered and once the child was finally calm, the father begins having a conversation with his wife over me and the man sitting infront of me, yelling at her for something. She passed him a pillow and he went to go and sleep ON the emergency exit lever. A flight attendant walked past, looked at him, and kept going despite the serious risk this could pose not only to him, but to everyone on the plane.

Suddenly, the flight encountered turbulence which promoted the child to begin screaming. Again. The wife begins screaming over us to the husband to wake him up and get him to tend to the baby. He doesn’t answer her and the baby miraculously falls back asleep before our flight attendant returned and ask the couple to take the child off the bassinet due to turbulence. I get up to use the bathroom and find that the husband is sitting in my seat, trying to once again place the baby on the floor. Once the baby began crying, they brought her back up again to their lap.

Throughout the flight, I had to stand up for the couple over 35 times. I was not able to sleep at all due to the constant screaming, crying, loud talking, and constant movement to appease the child and the parents. At one point, the flight attendant had to literally hand the baby over to the parents, over me and the man in front of me, because the couple refused to get up.
In addition to this, there were two other small children in front of me, and one behind me. I was surrounded by very young children who spent the entire flight screaming and bothering those around them. There was a 15-minute period where the two kids in front of me were standing up, facing me and yelling, while changing the content of my TV screen multiple times. The young child behind me at one point didn’t know how to open the bathroom door and began screaming bloody murder.

I fly for work multiple times a week across multiple airlines, have flown over 100,000 miles in 2023 alone, and I can confidently say that this was the worst flight experience I have ever had. 

Despite my multiple requests to switch seats, the flight attendants claimed there were no available options, even though there were visibly empty seats in my class. I upgraded my seat for a more comfortable experience, but the reality was far from British Airways' commitment to customer satisfaction, as ironically depicted in your onboard collateral. The entire flight, the entire crew was completely unbothered by my complaints or my experience. They did not once try to help me in the situation I was in, or offer any type of assistance with resolving the issue, despite the various options they had available to them. I would also be remiss to disregard the blatant disregard for safety displayed by the cabin crew. They allowed a 10-month old infant to be sat away from its parents, allowed a man to sleep on the emergency exit door and lever, and ignored a child being placed on the floor for flight travel",1.0,London,Newark,International,November 2023,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0

"I had called British airways to extend my flight for an extra 9 days, been told for 2 passengers the total price would be £188 which I was told on the phone had gone through. They sent me an email requesting me to call them two days later, I called them and they say the payment hasn’t gone through, we also tried two other bank cards that did not work. I went through this every two days, the bank details were correct and had sufficient funds. These calls cost me over £100 in credit as I was overseas, they did not have a local number and it seems their only phone number is in the UK. I ended up going to the airport ready to check in for my flight and they said I had “no ticket”, nobody working for British Airways at the airport could help us either (apart from us paying to buy two whole new tickets for over £1000). Once on the phone to them again at the airport, they said the price has changed to a total of £324. I told them I do not want to pay this as I had been told otherwise and they eventually agreed to the £188 in total. The payment finally went through 2 hours before my flight and we managed to board the plane last minute. Upon arriving back to London I can see that British airways have STOLEN an additional £137 from my bank account whilst I was on the flight, making the total price £324 surprise surprise. I never agreed to this and have not gotten a refund or heard anything back from my complaint. So not only did we get stress from nearly getting stuck and unable to go home, they also ROBBED ME on top of that. They showed no compassion to the fact that we did not travel for a holiday we travelled for a death and therefore were looking to spend as least as possible as we did not plan for this.

"There are no adequate words to express my displeasure and disappointment with my very first flight on British Airways. Firstly, my checked bag never made it to my destination in London! This was a straight flight! I never received any updates or information on it from the airline over the course of an 8+ day span. Had it not been for a good samaritan from Alaska Airways that had contacted me via my own personal luggage tag on my bag since my bag was completely untagged for a destination by the British Airways employee - an egrigious mistake on her part, and my own diligence to overcome her mistake, my bag would have never been found! Not having my own belongings has forever tarnished this trip and made it a struggle, and that’s beyond an understatement!! I had to spend unnecessary time in shopping centers and drug stores shopping for essential items that I needed in a foreign country because of their huge mistake, when I should have been enjoying my vacation that I worked hard for, earned, and saved for for YEARS!! Not to mention that my own prescription medications that I use daily for health issues and had to be put in my checked bag because of liquid restrictions never made it over, so that caused me additional health issues.

Regarding the actual flight, I wish to express my very poor review of that as well. When we landed at Heathrow, we were made to wait on the tarmac for a lengthy amount of time before being let off the plane, to the point where other patrons were concerned about missing their connecting fights. The time wasted waiting for shuttles to pick us up since a gate wasn’t even available for us to pull into is inexcusable. On top of all of this, another issue on the return home flight was that my new luggage that I had to purchase in London to come home with was damaged, where two of the wheels were completely missing! I have never encountered such disrespect and carelessness in any of my travels around the world! Much minor issues on other airlines and travels of mine have been more than compensated for, and they’ve gone above and beyond to keep their customer happy, correcting their errors and wishing to do everything that they can from a customer service standpoint to have me returning to fly with them again. I cannot say this happened in any way with the “customer service” of British Airways.

"We booked our florida holiday through the Disney travel company. We had a choice of 2 airlines, BA or Virgin. BA was slightly cheaper and the flight time was earlier. It wasnt until it was all booked that I found out that, despite paying for Premium, there would be a charge to book our seats and it was a lot. In total for both ways it was £320, significantly more than the Virgin flight. I phoned BA to query this and was told I should have read the T&Cs. Apart from being impossible as I had booked through Disney, I asked him if it was clear right from the start of searching for a holiday? As in in big writing and at the start of the process. Of course it isn't. You do not find out about this extortionate hidden charge until your flight is booked and paid for.
So we landed up stuck in the middle of a seat of 4 where we kept having to ask to go to the loo. I promise you BA never again and if I can warn anyone else of this practice and give them a heads up.

"I’ve been on close to 200 flights in my life and by far this was the worst experience. It was my very first time flying BA long haul. I’ve only been on short BA flights within Europe and they’ve been alright. This one however was pretty bad. 
From flight attendants that were lazy and made fun of passengers who didn’t speak English, to absolutely tiny seats where even a person like me (5’3 103lb) was very uncomfortable. Furthermore, there was not overhead space for the luggage, bc most had put their coats and small personal belongings in there. Now, I understand that it’s not the crew’s fault that most people are dumb, but they could make announcements to let them know that  the overhead space is for carry-on bags only like all other airlines do, and the smaller stuff goes under the seat.

"I checked in for my flights from INV to EWR via LHR for November 26,  24 hours in advance (November 25) and had seats assigned on both segments.   I boarded the INV-LHR flight knowing that BA 189 (LHR-EWR) had been down guaged (the gate agent at INV told me), but I still had boarding cards with my confirmed seats and that I would be OK.  Arriving in LHR the automated gate did not work with my LHR-EWR boarding card.  I was told I was put on standby and my seat assignments were no good for BA189. 
 I was told first to stand near the Standby desk until the flight closing time to find out if I had a seat.  After waiting for 40 minutes I was told to go to the gate (B35, T5). There I was told I was not going to fly on BA 189, but there was a possibility that I could go LHR-JFK on BA 179 which would leave at 6pm and arrive into JFK at 9:15pm. I said I would accept that as long as my checked baggage was on the same flight.  The agent said that would be guaranteed.  I was then asked to take the very long walk to the new gate (C56, T5) without taking the train since the latter would require me to go through a securuity check again. I did so and eventually boarded the flight. Arriving in JFK I waited an hour for my bags which never showed.  At that point a BA staff informed me that they knew my bags were arriving on Nov 27 on a different flight (BA 117). Also since my home was more than 100 miles from JFK, they would not be delivered until Nov 29.

I give BA a failing grade for 2 things:
1. Denying me boarding when I already had boarding pass for BA189, and not explaining the reason to me.
2. Not being truthful to me saying that my bags would fly on BA 179 if I accepted the switch of destination to JFK. This appears to be a tactic that is frequently used by BA staff to get disgruntled passengers off their hands (this was laughingly explained to me by BA staff at JFK). While I was getting regular emails from BA about my upcoming flights, I never received any informing me of a. my denied boarding situation, or b. My bags not flying with me (even as they knew it as I saw on the screen of the baggage handler in JFK).

I am not going to swear about not flying BA ever, because you never know! 

But I do want people to know this institutionalized practice of gate agents not being truthful  to passengers and denying boarding to passengers with seat assignments without explaining the metric followed.  Never take their words as truth.  
I have verified that if it wants, BA can identify who were lying to me yesterday as the IDs of gate agents who switched my reservation are recorded by the system. 

If they had leveled with me that my bags would most likely not be on the flight, I would have waited in London for the next flight to EWR.

Please beware of these less than truthful gate agents at BA (definely for LHR, but probably also true for BA across the board. Finally, before I get comments such as this happens at other airlines too, please let me tell you that I have experienced such blatant lying to my face rarely in my 35 years as a frequent flyer.",1.0,Inverness,Newark,International,November 2023,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

"Our previous experience of a business class seat in British Airways in something never to be forgotten. Then, the seating was so bad that travellers had to step over the legs of a fellow passenger to leave their seat if they were lying down. This time though, I flew in a refurnished 777. And, oh what a joy. This rivals any other airline's business class seat.
Carrying a separate bag with some expensive delicate glassware, the extremely helpful stewardess offered to place my bag inside one of the cabin crew's lockers for me. This was so good of her, as the glassware was too delicate to be placed in an overhead locker.
The food was good, but having already eaten in their airport lounge I did not feel like eating too much. Each and every member of the cabin crew always had a warm smile whenever they walked by or I got up to stretch my legs. Even with lie-flat seats it is still important to get up every so often to stretch the legs.
The seating is comfortable with heaps of leg room. I only watched one film, as I wanted to get some sleep. Sadly, this is not always possible whilst flying.

"Airport Delay
Return flight was delayed by about 45 minutes.
 Pilots got stuck in traffic.
 Crew got stuck in traffic. 
Waited because of this group 1-9 stuff BA rolled out too many groups.

On Board
No space for bags on board so had it put at the front of the aircraft. 
Lady in the seat next to me was a dead head and took up a portion of my seat.

In flight 
Take off was fine.  
Small Child was sick in front of me and throughout the flight they carried sick bag after sick bag to the toilet and locked the toilet at the back. 
All the while the toilet at the front was unable to lock and another passenger fainted in one so down to two toilets for 200+ people.
How they handled the sick passengers was odd making them come to the back of the plane some of the time and blocking the aisle other times. Thats on BA. Hope the other passengers get better. 
There was a lot of coughing caused by the air con throughout the flight and no water offered outside of meals. 
I was told by a flight attendant only one blanket is given a seat and mine was stolen during the flight. 
Turbulence was near constant but the seat belt sign was left on for two hours. 
When it was off for 15 minutes there were up to 60 people trying to use one toilet. 

Food
The food was called beef biryani but was sausage and mash in a oil sauce not nice. 
Breakfast was full english and was ok to eat.
Drink service happened once and again with the dinner 20 minutes later.

Service
Bearing in mind they had two ill passengers. They were sorted by the 4 hour mark.
Poor. 
Food service took a long time. 
Manners were lacking. 
They disappeared from the 4 hour mark til the 10 hour mark. All of them.
They were talking in the back before this and after this.

Planes wings tipped from side to side. 
Landed 1h+ late
Bags were not brought back had to go and find them along with other passengers.

"We were booked for an Egypt Tour departing the US on December 3, 2023.  In late October, the tour operator cancelled the tour because of the proximity to warfare in Gaza.  We had made our own flight arrangements.  I immediately called British Airways to cancel the flights.  Cancellation was around 6 weeks prior to departure.  The agent with whom I spoke said that BA was still flying to Cairo, so there would be a fee for cancellation.  OK I was hoping for a credit, but whatever it is it is.  She said that there was $200 cancellation free per person.  OK whatever it is it is.  When I see the amount they returned to me, they had not deducted $400, as I expected, they had deducted $858.  It took multiple additional calls to find out that that the Cancellation fee was $200 per person, PER DIRECTION.  On another call I learned that in addition to the Cancellation fee, there was $50 Change Fee.  Had the first agent explained all this I would not be angry.  But she lied to me, and it seemed like corporate policy as geting the actual fees out of other agents required at least 10 other calls.  On every call I asked to speak to a supervisor.  I was put on hold for EXACTLY 5 minutes and then told that no supervisor was available.  I was further directed to file further complaints on the website.  So I went to the website and complained about the abysmal customer service and to a lesser extent, that I thought the fees were unnecessarily high.  After exactly 30 days I got a e-mail from British Airways saying they were working on my problem.  A few days later I got what is obviously a standard response to a complaint about fees. The e-mail read that fees are spelled out in Contract for Service and to get over it.  They could have sent that dismissive BOT-driven response in 5 minutes but they waited a month.

"We paid for extra leg room seats only to find out on check in that they were removed from us and resold months ago and we weren't informed nor refunded. The reason being that we had requested wheelchair assistance for 1 person. Once the reason was explained that kind of makes sense except the exit row conditions state no disability, and the wheelchair wasnt for a disability or opening a heavy door, it's for walking distances. 

Anyway the issue is that we were not informed, and it wasn't just one seat removed it was both. The woman on the phone was also sarcastic and rude and I had to escalate to management to actually have a conversation about this. They are now being refunded.

Furthermore, when we arrived for our layover, there was no wheelchair assistance available as they said there wasn't enough and we had to wait around for 20 mins (on a 2 hour layover) before someone could come with one.

Terrible service all round except for the individuals on the plane. The steward was great and made lots of jokes and helped us out with any issues.

Kicker - because the screens pivot out of the wall, they have to be put back in their position 20-30 mins before landing (as the crew prepares the cabin).

We had to take a bus to the aircraft and then climb up (about) 25-30 steps to board.

Boarding itself was pleasant as there was soft music being played accompanied with some soothing and cool mood lighting!

Today’s flight is on a Boeing 777.  I was sitting in Premium Economy, seat 21A which is directly over the back part of the wing!

Waiting at the seat was a pillow and blanket.  I don’t tend to find this pillow useful but some might, but I really like the blanket!  It is soft, cosy and perfect as a throw!  

Once seated, a member of the cabin crew offered a welcome drink, a choice of water or prosecco!  This was followed by a menu.  You can see the full menu in the video.

The safety video was played and we were taking off!  As soon as the seatbelt sign was turned off after take-off, a cabin crew member offered a hot towel!  So far, this is not to dissimilar to a business class flight!

The inflight entertainment screen (or IFE) is 12”, which is 2” bigger than in economy. The quality of the display is quite old and therefore poor.  I am 99% blind and so need to sit very close to the screen which means the quality diminishes further!  If you are able to sit back and watch then it is okay.

Under the IFE is a charging port.  On the inside leg of my seat is a control panel which you can use to control the IFE as well as turn on the reading light above or call for help.

The tray table is stored in the armrest in between my seat and my neighbour’s seat.  Be careful when pulling it out or putting it back in as it can be a little fiddly.  

Also next to the armrest is a cocktail table to share with your neighbour and alond the spine of the cocktail table are 2 universal power plugs for charging your devices!

In the seat pocket was a plastic bag which contained over-the-ear headphones which I thought were comfortable and quite good quality. There was also a kit bag that contained a toothbrush, toothpaste, eye shades, socks and lip balm!  Again, nice for Premium Economy and not to dissimilar to a Business Class product!

Dinner was served, I had pre-ordered a vegan meal.  I was served a salad consisting of lettuce, 1 cherry tomato, 2 thin slices of radish and I think there was 1 slice of cucumber.  I wasn’t too impressed but the cherry tomato was nice!  The main course was tofu chunks in a tomato sauce and basmati rice.  This was very bland and tasteless.  The tofu chunks were quite nice I suppose.  There was also a dessert – a cake of some kind which was okay.

I wasn’t offered a drink with my meal, so I pressed the call button after about 15 minutes.  No one attended!  After an hour I managed to get hold of a crew member to get a drink, by then I had already long finished my meal!

The lavatory was fairly clean but a bit limited on the amenities side.  But we did get the kit bag with toothbrush and so on, so I guess it isn’t too bad.  However, the toilet role was running low!  

After the meal service was completed, the crew handed out vanilla ice cream cups to everyone.  They didn’t have anything for anyone who had ordered a special meal though.

I had a little nap and just before landing, the crew had turned the lights up and began serving breakfast.  Breakfast was a wrap which was delicious!  I had also asked for some snacks and so they gave me a packet of cashew nuts and shortbread biscuits.  

I have found on my last few long haul BA flights, there seems to always be a shortage of cabin crew.  This does affect the service a little but the crew that are on board always work very hard and are usually friendly and helpful (as best as they can).

We purchased this ticket using Avios but the cash equivalent for London to Newark, return in October/November 2023, was around £900~ which I think is very reasonable for a 7 hr+ journey in premium economy!

"Unfortunately, I have not heard anything from British Airways, after more than 3 weeks of sending my complaint against British Airways luggage boarding employee in Cairo International Airport (He claimed his name to be Hussein). Indeed, I had the most awful experience with the British Airways employees during processing my boarding pass at Cairo Airport. This boarding pass employee (Hussein) bluntly refused to check in my carry on piece of luggage. He claimed that it was not the right size, though it was the right size and though I have used it for many flights before. He rudely and aggressively asked me to use the standard metal stand for carry on luggage in front of him without even offering any help, though I had back disk emplacement. He was so aggressive with me in front of other British Airways passengers who were very shocked from this employee rude attitude. Though the bag size was right, and though the other passengers were witnesses that my luggage size was right, BA employee (Hussein) refused to check in my luggage and asked me to give him 3500 Egyptian pounds or he would not complete my check in procedures. Furthermore he refused to give me my British passport back till I give him the money. I refused to give him the money, and I had to leave my luggage in Cairo Airport. This  employee was so rude, so aggressive, and have the worriest employee customer service ever. I have been flying for decades, using the most famous airlines, and I have never seen such rude customer service. He was shouting at me, bulling me by words that I would not be able to go on board till I pay him. This man has really disrupted my whole flight and my days till this moment. Moreover, I had an exam in UK, and I had to leave my study materials in the bag which I had to leave in the airport because he refused to check it in. By the way I have BA passengers as witnesses on my situation and how aggressive and discriminative your boarding employee was.
I have been humiliated, and bullied by your employee. I had to suffer psychologically in my exam which was second day to my flight with you. It is shame to have such employees in your BA company. Such employees are really distroying your British Airways reputation and putting your business down over the years.
I am really so disappointed with British Airways service and their showing of no interest solve out my serious complaint.

"Absolutely awful experience with BA! Flight from Vienna was delayed. Staff were terrible and completely unprofessional. Our boarding passes were not checked at the gate, they asked us for a seat number (didn’t check this) and were scribbling it down on a piece of scrap paper! Incredibly unsafe and unprofessional, Vienna has mass holding areas for a number of gates, so anyone from any of these gates could have easily tried to board our flight or accidentally got on the wrong plane! Where staff were rushed they then failed to pack the plane correctly, meaning that hand luggage had to be taken to go in the hold. Our bags were taken off us and we weren’t given anything to say these had been taken. We got to the plane and realised this was the case and went back down the tunnel to question this with staff who then scribbled again on a label, barely readable, and gave it to us- no idea if that actually had any reference to anything on our bags as they didn’t seem to check this. There was no apology or acknowledgment and they just seemed annoyed that we wanted some confirmation that they had our bags. Upon boarding the plane there was a huge mix up with seats with people across 3 rows all sat in the wrong place where one member of staff had said this was okay. This then caused problems for later passengers boarding and trying to sit in their allocated seats.. including ourselves- 2 passengers didn’t even have seats and had to wait until the whole plane had been seated to then be split up and sat in the remaining seats. We were held in the aisle for ages whilst a different member of staff disagreed that these mis-seated passengers could sit in these seats- it was absolute chaos. When we eventually did get to our seats there was plenty of space in the overhead lockers which was incredibly frustrating. Upon arrival at Heathrow and collecting our bags, one of our suitcases had been damaged to the point where it will have to be thrown away as all of the wheels have been smashed during transit. Incredibly frustrating given we didn’t want to put this in the hold in the first place and there was room on the plane. They were clearly in a rush and did not take care of our luggage. Upon making a number of complaints to BA about the above, I received incredibly poor responses. They only addressed the baggage damage and told me they had passed on the complaint but that I had to call a luggage repair company they used to follow this up . I have replied 3 times asking them to Address my other complaints and asking why I need to follow this up when it was them who caused this issue. I have been round and round in circles with no valid responses and no acknowledgment of any issue other than my damaged bag and no solution to this problem either.

"Oh, boy, where do I even start? This was beyond awful! The worst flight of my life.

1. After everyone boarded the plane, the pilot announced that due to congestion at London airport, we'd have to wait on the plane before takeoff... FOR 1.5 HOURS!!! So yes, in addition to the 5-hour flight, all passengers sat together for an extra hour and a half.

2. Food... a complimentary, tiny snack bar! Sounds great, right? Well, only if you're not seat in the middle of the plane, because there weren't enough snack bars for everyone, including me :)))

3. Toilets! NO WATER! Yes! None of the toilets had any water! You could use the toilet, but forget about washing your hands. Solution: don't go to the toilet; it's just a 5-hour flight plus 1.5 hours of delay, you can hold it in. And not a single wet wipe was provided either.

4. The airplane seats were budget-level. Seats don't recline, legroom is minimal.

5. Upon landing, we found that there was no congestion at the airport at all! The airport was practically empty. Maybe, somehow, miraculously, all the congestion cleared just before our arrival :) So, the question of why we were forced to sit on the plane for an extra hour and a half remains unanswered.

6. Baggage claim... it was the slowest baggage claim I've ever experienced in my life. One suitcase came out every 5-8 seconds. It felt like one person was unloading, occasionally taking breaks to watch football.

7. But the best part was yet to come... After waiting for 40 minutes at the carousel, my suitcase never came out!!! No, they didn't lose it; they just decided to send it on the next evening flight. NOT A SINGLE PERSON TOLD ME ABOUT THIS!!! I came on a business trip for several days and had to spend an extra 2 hours sorting out my baggage issue and then another 3.5 hours the next day to retrieve it from the airport. British Airways couldn't deliver my luggage the next day; I had to either wait for 3 to 5 days or go to the airport myself. My first business meeting was in a sweater, jeans, and sneakers, not a suit, because all my clothes were in the baggage, and I didn't have time to buy new ones.

In conclusion: the worst airline. Due to this airline, I lost an entire day during my 4-day business trip and had a lot of nerve-wracking experiences. I fly frequently due to the nature of my work, and I have a lot of flight experience with various airlines. But even when using low-cost carriers, I've never had such a terrible experience.

"We usually fly with Virgin but, as they didn't fly direct to Mexico, we chose British Airways. I had heard some real horror stories about them as a company recently but the flight was actually fine and got us there and back in one piece.

Premium economy was fairly spacious, there was a goody bag on the chair, there was an okay drink selection and the seats reclined back pretty well - so it wasn't as bad when the person in front put their seat back. 

There was a bit of a rubbish selection of films & TV shows, with limited new ones, but it was fine... first world problems right!? 

The other thing that was very annoying was BOTH ways to and from Mexico, they run out of the selection of dinner we wanted by the time they had got to us. Because I don't eat fish or eggs and they had run out of the meat option and the veg option was egg based - so I didn't have any dinner on the way home. I thought that was pretty unacceptable given that we had paid extra to be in premium economy and for it to happen not just one but both ways. Really?!

"Appreciate that this is very much a #firstworldproblems review but, having had this offered to me by BA because of an issue on a previous flight, I was excited to see what this would be like. Having experienced it, I wouldn't pay for it.

At JFK, BA and AA have a lounge just for First Class passengers (The Chelsea Lounge) - nice enough but did not meet their advertised standard so bizarrely I ended up disappointed. As this is supposed to be a flagship lounge, BA’s concept of flagship is not reassuring. I would suggest that they get someone in from one of the top hotels to shake things up and raise the standard to what they market it as.  Example: all staff in top class restaurants know that you absolutely do not speak loudly across the lounge to your colleagues. Happened several times. No choice of fruit juices. Someone near me asked for tomato juice but they only had orange. I'd expect a choice and certainly for them to have tomato to make a Bloody Mary for example. No one came to take my food/drink order. I had to go ask someone to do this. And this also happened to another passenger too which is really very poor and smacks of systematic issues (too much cost-cutting? too few staff?). Food was so-so for freshly cooked - mine was really not good at all and I suspect that it wasn’t all truly freshly cooked as there is a buffet in the associated Soho (business class) lounge next door. Why no milk jugs? I got milk in an espresso cup which is not easy to pour from.

Needs to have somewhere to put your cabin luggage so you can go to shops if you want to. Overheated. No windows. When I connected to the ‘get newspapers & magazines’ section of the lounge free WiFi, you have to pay for the papers/magazines. Seriously? At this price point?

Redeeming features: Lots of power outlets including USB C which was great. Comfortable seating and lots of it so you are not on top of each other.

All in all - and it pains me to say this - it is perfectly pleasant but I was led to expect so much more. Lacks finesse. So I can’t recommend it. 

Moving on to the flight itself - on the aircraft, the first cabin was only 8 seats. All full.

Virtually no at-seat storage which is a bit weird given the space for each seat. And that all passengers will have a small bag/iPad/headphones/laptop, etc.

Service efficient: one of the flight attendants was lovely but the other one was rather cold to the extent that I don’t think that they really wanted to be there. 

There was also some issue with the ordering of food. I was offered a meal that I had not ordered so it must have been requested by someone else. 

Like the Chelsea lounge, the service on the flight was pleasant enough but lacked that finesse you'd expect at the top end.  I was expecting something more at the Mandarin Oriental level of service - this wasn't it.

"This was our return trip from DXB to LHR in PE on a B787.  Unfortunately, the plane had the same issues as the A380 going out in that the cabin and seating were very tired and needed an upgrade.  For the price you pay you expect the equipment to work and again the seat recline mechanism did not operate correctly and the IFE is poor.  I feel the partnership with Paramount+ has reduced the quality of the IFE content.  The music and films were so poor I watched all three Godfather films back to back!

The cabin crew and the F&B were good and could not be faulted, I have to say this is the best part of the BA package IMO and it is what makes the company.

The lounge in DXB is small with enjoyable food and nice coffee, there are also a mix of alcoholic beverages if you require it.

"Terrible from start to finish.

Service on the ground and in the air was the sort of shoulder shrugging attitude from every member of staff that BA seem to have perfected.

The 24 year old B777 was tired inside and out.  The cabin had barely been cleaned, with food debris and wrappers still on the floor in business class. The seat covers on several seats we’re not attached properly with filthy foam underneath.

Cabin service was port throughout. They admitted to being short staffed, which meant the safety briefing has to be repeated.  Food and drink options ran out mid flight, with most passengers told they couldn’t have their first option. 

Empty glasses and dishes were left on tray tables, with several passengers opting to clear their own.

When we arrived we were greeted by an SMS saying both our bags hadn’t made the flight.  Turns out not just ours…. 23 other passengers had missing bags too.

The crew onboard couldn’t have cared less. Merely muttering no one had told them about it and it was the ground handling agent’s problem.

Which would have been OK if there had been a ground handling agent even visible in the terminal for over 30 mins.

There was no hint of an apology or any intention to put it right.  Just a very long queue to fill in a paper form.

BA had multiple options to get the baggage flown out, including with other airlines to get it there faster. Instead they chose the cheapest option for them which was on their own next service to PLS in 4 days.  Despite this the instruction was to only but essentials which they class as “a toothbrush, toothpaste and undergarments”.  Perfect for that luxury Caribbean holiday!

In summary. Just avoid them.  BA is a no frills airline at every level that thinks it’s still the 80s and it’s the world’s favourite.

We arrived at the airport to the good news we had been upgraded to Club World. We also received a $19 food voucher each. The BA lounge here is pleasant and we patiently waited for boarding. The delay rolled on by 30 minutes and then we were called to gate. We stood in a disorganised priority queue and were informed of another delay. Returned to lounge and called again in an hour. Stood some more. Ground staff seemed confused. Unhelpful announcement about how much longer we would be waiting. In the end we left 4.5 hours late. Poorly handled over all.

The highlights of the flight were the pleasant crew and the amazing food. Don’t love the old BA Ying and Yang style seats where you are facing others. Qantas and Emirates are much better.

Thanks for upgrade but wouldn’t pay cash for Club World. Especially when the business tagged bags came off last.

"I had a great flight out to Tokyo, going under Russia. We got there in about 13 hours. The flight back to London, however, was a nightmare. Took a polar route above Alaska (which took longer) and the plane changed altitude a lot, the turbulence was bad and motion sickness was terrible. I threw up about four times, had a flight attendant suggest it was food poisoning but I was fine as soon as we landed so I think not. The flight attendants were nice hence the 3* but I wouldn't choose BA for another flight to SEA if this is the route.",2.0,Tokyo,London,International,November 2023,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
"Having flown BA in 2018 & 2021 to St. Lucia, economy class with poor experiences, we chose to pay in excess of £1100 to upgrade to premium economy. For this we could not book seats in advance without paying a further £100 - £160 each way. Both ways the 24hr online check in was not available, resulting in my wife and I initially being sat 2 rows and 7 seats apart (outbound) and being allocated different seats to those eventually allocated (inbound). As for food, on the way out there was no choice past the 3rd of 6 rows, my wife did not eat, and on the way back the options of choice made it to the 4th row - I eventually got a meal from Economy 25 minutes after the rest of Premium. The snacks provided both ways  were solidly attached to their cardboard packaging - maybe this is why they tasted of cardboard! To add insult to every thing else, a delay of almost 3 hrs meant we missed our train back to the north of Scotland, costing us £70 extra. British Airways have apologised and hope to welcome us back on a future occasion.

"Travelled to Brussels from Aberdeen via Heathrow T5, and our flight had already been cancelled and changed on the first leg, then delayed from T5 to Brussels meaning we had missed our connection, so stayed the night in a Brussels airport hotel. Claim 1. Then on our return, flight delayed back to London so missing our connection to Aberdeen, stayed the night in airport hotel London. Claim 2. 
Couldn't get us on a flight from London to Aberdeen the next day, but offered us to travel to Dublin then onward to Aberdeen which we reluctantly accepted.

Now this was all an inconvenience for sure! but the way we were treated by BA ground staff was inexcusable, very rude and a 'well its not my fault, couldn't care less attitude' was very plain to see.

So the claims - I've been waiting several weeks for my claims to be processed and once the claims in you cant speak to a real person regarding any updates, and when I tried, the customer relations department (when they were actually open) couldn't assist me and reverted me back to online or just simply hung up!

I would class myself as a seasoned traveller having travelled regularly through my work for the past 30 years taking on average 20 to 24 flights per year with various airlines, some better than others I might add, however, I've always found BA to be one of the top airlines to travel with....until recently. Whats happened to this airline, there was a time when it was the flagship of the UK, but sadly has just become another corporate shareholder value machine with little regard for its customers.

"In short they cancelled our flights with little to no warning and no support offered from BA. We had to scramble to get a train ticket down to London to catch a connecting flight to Orlando which meant the start of the holiday was extremely stressful and even more expensive.

When trying to claim the money back from BA in early October after we landed BA did not respond for weeks after providing flight info and receipts that showed the emergency travel that had to be booked due to the sudden cancelation. They eventually contacted us about a refund and requested banking information which was provided and said the money would be in my account in 14 working days. ALMOST A MONTH LATER, the money is still not in my account I'm still trying to push through this claim.

"Vowed never to fly with BA if we could help it, but they were the nominated carrier despite booking a Virgin cruise from Athens to Dubai.  Flight out to Athens was ok to be fair, although the service offered was poor but on time.   The return sector from Dubai was lousy !  Easy check in at Dubai airport, but nightmare when boarding announced in lounge area.  Why on earth don’t they get it right ? By that I mean they announced groups towards the front of the plane to board first which of cours clogged up the passage ways for those who had seats further back ! Surely it’s easier to get those onboard who are at the back and work the way forward from there ?? No drink served before take off in our section ! Why is that, surely BA can afford a glass of water or orange juice in this day and age.  Air crew looked as though they didn’t want to be there and it was reflected in their overall service.  No wine offered with food ( had to ask and was greeted with a sigh, oh dear ) or should I say ‘old dear’, where do they recruit their cabin crew from, old people’s homes or what ?  Food was awful ( not the cabin crew’s fault admittedly ) and as for the excuse for a snack just before landing, oh my god, who provides such slop.  Toilets out of order at the rear of plane from take off.   I don’t know why I bother with reviews of BA as they never respond to any reviews, but hopefully will never fly with them again.

"We flew to Tokyo via Heathrow and whilst the flight itself was fine. The airline lost our luggage, claiming 'they didn't have enough time' between the flights to load our bags. The BA lost luggage app was useless and we spent our first few days in Tokyo anxious, without our belongings and medication. Fortunately, our luggage arrived but that was thanks to the efficiency and top notch service of Haneda Airport who were supportive and better at communicating (ironically despite English not being their first language!)

Our return flight home was again, fine until we returned to Heathrow and onto our Manchester flight. The BA staff on the gate were rude and couldn't/wouldn't communicate. The team were trying to get volunteers to check in hand baggage, to which we volunteered, along with others (despite us been nervous as to whether we'd see it again!) 

We were then herded into a corner while the staff chatted amongst themselves. Others were waiting confused, we weren't sure if we were boarding or awaiting further instruction. More staff came and went and eventually, a few of us just decided to wander down the escalators and make our own way. We then found more staff to ask what they'd like us to do with our hand luggage that would be going in the hold. They looked confused, as if we should have been given some instruction. Eventually we boarded our second flight (after travelling 21 hours) which was then delayed for 30 minutes, which I believe was Heathrow's fault - not BA. However, all in all, an anxious uncomfortable and stressful experience that has put us off long haul flights for the foreseeable.

"We planned the trip of a lifetime to Scotland.  Our usual traveling companions are our son and daughter-in-law.  They live about an hour west of Denver and we live three hours northeast of Phoenix, so they flew from Denver to Phoenix, where we boarded an American Airlines plane as a provider for British Airways, for a flight to London Heathrow.  We purchased Premium Economy for our entire flight because of the additional leg room as my husband and son are both well over 6 feet tall.  The flight to London took off at 6pm, so we were on board for the next 11 hours. The seats were great, the legroom was perfect, and the flight crew was attentive, kind, and supportive.  We enjoyed the food, the beverages and the entertainment available for each person.  It was an A+ trip.  From Heathrow to Glasgow, we traveled on a British Airways flight in regular economy seating.  Big difference in the comfort factor, but it was a short flight, and we were able to get through happily.  Unfortunately, the return trip turned into much discomfort, distress and dismay.  It also ended up costing us quite a bit of money, time and inconvenience.  A few hours before our departure from Glasgow to London, I received an email that our flight was changed and that we would have to take seats in Economy.  When we arrived in Glasgow, I asked why we were being moved to Economy, when we paid for Premium Economy.  The answer came across as 'too bad, you'll get a refund on your credit card'.  We asked if we could upgrade our Premium Economy to First Class.  The answer was a curt 'No'.  Exasperated, we had no other options.  My husband and checked three suitcases and our kids checked three suitcases. Already upset, the flight was running very late and we had to walk out the tarmac and climb stairs into the back of the plane. At this point, the time indicated that we would most likely miss our connecting flight.  However, British Airways had even more up their sleeve for us.  We were originally ticketed from Glasgow to London, London to Chicago and then Chicago to Phoenix.  The flghts changed again, which changed the gate to a different terminal.  At Heathrow, traveling between terminals can be difficult at best.  After walking what felt like over a mile, I was searched for some reason that no one seemed to know, and then we were herded onto a bus to drive around 15 minutes to a different terminal.   Just as we were getting off the bus, I received a message from British Airways that  our flight was being changed from a direct flight to Phoenix to a 6-hour layover in Charlotte, NC.  Out of the blue a few minutes later we were boarding a British Airways plane for a direct flight to Phoenix.  Unfortunately, it was in Economy, not the Premium Economy we paid for in good faith.  The next 10 hours were extremely uncomfortable for all four of us.  The flight crew was not nearly as happy and helpful as before.  We were sardined into four consecutive seats in the middle of the plane, yet there were two people seated in three seats in two rows across from us.  Finally, we landed in Phoenix around 4 hours later than was originally scheduled, so we had to cancel our scheduled hotel and get one closer to the airport since our kids had to catch an early flight to Denver.  Thinking things had to only get better, we stood at the luggage claim for almost an hour only to be the unlucky ones whose luggage didn't make it the same destination at the same time.  We went directly to the Lost Luggage counter and were given a letter and claim tickets.  Unfortunately, they had put only two bags in mine and my husband's names and four bags in our kids' names - we were told that the luggage should arrive the next evening, but that there were no guarantees.  Well, the kids had flights to Denver already planned for early the next morning, and we had to drive our three hours back home, so we would not be able to stay in the Phoenix area to wait to see if our luggage would arrive anytime soon.  Therefore, we were told that the luggage would be given to couriers and delivered directly to our homes.  We arrived home late Saturday afternoon, discouraged, sore and in pain.  On Sunday afternoon, I received a phone call from American Airlines in Denver, Colorado asking if I was coming into Denver today.  Of course, no I wasn't going to Denver, so we had a conversation about what had happened, and she asked me for the claim number.  After giving it to her, she said, 'That isn't an American Airlines claim number, so I'm going to have to give these bags to British Airways.'  Adamantly, I begged her not to do that and that I would call my son to see if he might be able to drive to Denver International Airport right away because after 4:30pm, they would be giving the bags to British Airways.  Luckily, our son and daughter-in-law were able to drive the hour to DIA and meet up with the very nice lady from American Airlines.  They collected four pieces of luggage - two of theirs and two of ours!  Next came an agonizing week long search for the other two pieces of baggage.  They were given to a courier who called my husband on Monday afternoon telling him that he was maybe five minutes from house, but that he couldn't deliver to our home, so would my husband meet him.  Sure, my husband was just leaving work, so he asked the guy where he was located.  The guy gave him crossroads in Phoenix, which he proceeded to tell the guy that our address to where the luggage should be delivered is over 3 hours drive away from Phoenix up in the White Mountains.  He responded that they don't deliver to our location and that he would take the bags back to his office.  We called and called the office of the courier, left messages, but did not receive a return call.  On Wednesday, my daughter-n-law texted the number and the lady called her!  After explaining what the luggage looked like and the names on the tags, the lady texted her a picture of the luggage and yes sirree, it was one of ours and one of theirs!  A few days later, I took time off work and drove three hours to Phoenix/Tempe to pick up our luggage at the courier's office.  After driving the three hours back home, we talked to our kids about how we would now get our two suitcases from them and them to get their one from us!  On the following Sunday, I drove six hours to Sante Fe, New Mexico.  Our son and daughter-in-law drove 8 hours to Sante Fe, New Mexico where we met up and exchanged our essential and personal luggage.  As you can tell, this whole process was not only stressful, but very expensive for all of us.   Between paying for Premium Economy seats and getting downgraded without any compensation, all of the inconvenient plane time changes, and then the gas, food, lost work hours and wear and tear on our vehicles, our minds, and our pocketbooks, we should all be compensated monetarily at least from British Airways.  I would never recommend British Airways to anyone who is looking for a comfortable and enjoyable flight.",1.0,Glasgow,Phoenix,International,September 2023,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0

"I have a nut allergy so I contacted customer services who said don’t worry they will give you nut free food on board . However this was not the case , a snippy cabin member said I’d have to sign something if I wanted to eat so they wouldn’t be liable and that they were taking no responsibility for me. She indicated due to the processing system there could be cross contamination. So 14 hour flight with no food.  Then 2 lovely cabin members gave me a packet of crisps and some fruit , if it had been the
 other staff members I would have starved. I was then given conflicting information regarding the food , saying it’s ok as long as labelled with no nuts in it but the other crew member said it was not safe to do this . Get your information correct please so everyone of your team is saying the same.  I felt discriminated against especially in the age of inclusion that we are living in ( this was by certain staff members as the other ones couldn’t have been nicer .

"In fairness I will begin this review by saying that all four flights on this return journey were on time. But overall my husband and I were not really happy with a number of things. 
As it was an extremely long flight (12hours on first leg) we’d booked premium economy seats and though we would enjoy the ‘perks’ advertised, such as the welcome glass of fizz before take off. Well when the attendant came round with a tray there was only orange juice or water. When I asked if there was some fizz, the reply was that they didn’t have any on board…….this was before the flight had taken off! Later when the ‘complementary’ drinks  service came round I asked for Jack Daniels ( as I find it relaxes my muscles and helps me to sleep……well ……and I also enjoy it ) There was no Jack Daniels either, and this was the same on all four flights we took on this trip.
Later,  the food was ok but nothing special and the desserts on the tray were uncovered, which I think is pretty unhygienic especially as it had travelled through a full cabin with people coughing etc. After finishing the meal we then sat for forty five minutes waiting to have our trays taken away, which of course made getting up to visit the toilet impossible, and also was uncomfortable having that in front of you for so long unable to move or reach down to your bag etc.
We had taken off just after 9pm and after drinks being offered with the meal, no more were offered before the lights were dimmed around 11.45. The lights remained dimmed for 8.5 hours, which was a long time for a flight,  then an unappetising and hurried breakfast was served. There were no bread rolls available to have with breakfast, which I found unusual and disappointing. During the ‘sleep period’ no trays of water/ juice were brought round for those awake. True you could press for service but it would be nice not to feel you were inconveniencing someone.
And the seats…..well it is true that they are bigger and leg room is better than economy but they have a large column between the seats which protrude beyond the seat depth so when the person in front reclines their seat there is very little room left for the window seat occupant to get passed it without having to be a contortionist.
Of the four flights taken on this long trip, only once were we offered a hot towel service.
Having paid £6,000 for two of us to Australia, we were certainly not impressed with these BA flights and have decided not to use BA again.",1.0,London,Sydney,International,October 2023,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0
"lets get right into it, before I booked my flight with British Airways from Canada to the UK I had called 3x to insure that I could fly with my PET in cabin (this means my 5 pond dog would be in his travel bag under the seat in front of me) they told me YES! So 1500$ later i called to add my pet to my ticket ... and then they told me NO!? After 4 days of getting transfer to different departpenmt and being told to send emails because you can't speak with anyone directly and no one could give me a clear answer (keep in mind the time difference I had to wake ups at 4am Canadian time) finaly 1 person out of everyone told me only ' service dogs ' are allowed!

"Where do i begin?

This airline cost me another flight for my wife and I because of a major delay. I provided all the proof (Website airline tracking data, Guest affidavit, photo and video evidence) so they could confirm the delay in an email. All the proof was there and I was not seeking compensation at first from them however through my travel insurance. So there was no reason for them to dispute my claims, however It turns out they were protecting themselves from a claim.

They lied multiple times on email that grossly reduced the time delayed to cover a claim against them. Refuting any responsibility and changing their reply multiple times to different reasons for the delay. They kept reducing the time delayed with every response and totally disregarded my evidence supplied. This caused my travel insurance to decline my claim because they rely on a written response from the airline confirming the delay.

I gave them multiple chances to do right by myself and my wife however they clearly do not care about their customers. I have now resorted to getting CEDR involved because of their lack of compassion and fabricating a web of lies to protect them from liability. 

Even on the delayed flight which had to get special clearance from air traffic control to leave the following day after midnight (00:31am). Heathrow does not allow flights beyond (00:00am). The flight back to South Africa was appalling. A few people had broken seats (myself included). No water on the plane in the upper (A380) rear end cabin. This means many could not use that bathroom. Food was served at (01:30am)... then a rushed service for breakfast in the morning literally 30mins before landing. The staff were tired and absolutely in a shambles. Some had worked back to back flights according to them. 
  
We were promised by BA crew that anyone who missed a connecting flight on arrival, would be met by local crew. They would help us rebook flights or provide alternate options to whoever is inconvenienced. They were not there, leaving well over (20) of us scrambling to make alternate plans. I must make it clear they never came at all.

Overall i would never recommend them to anyone. Rather fly an alternate airline if you care to never go through an issue like many of us did.",1.0,London,Johannesburg,International,August 2023,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0

It honestly is as not much better than Exinomy.

"Travelled Newcastle, via Heathrow, to Seattle and supposedly onto Victoria. Missed connection at Seattle  due to not being informed we would have to collect our hold luggage at Seattle and go through passport control. There was not enough time. There was at least 1000 people trying to get through passport control.  We were still in a queue when our connecting flight left without us. We were then told by Alaska Airlines they could not get a flight for us for over two days., we were under the impression it was a British Airways flight but apparently not. There was no British Airline staff available to speak to at Seattle airport. Having eventually getting onto a website for BA WE WERE INFORMED NO HUMAN COLLEAGUES WERE AVAILABLE TO HELP. Alaska Airlines said they had no contract with BA to help get a transfer flight. Absolute nightmare. Four Seattle sheriffs helped us get a ferry from Seattle to Victoria and a hotel for the night.

"The BER counter was only open from 1-1/2 hours before departure to one hour before departure.   Electronic boarding passes are not available, so you have to check in at the counter.   If you follow the BER recommendation to be at the airport 3 hours before an international departure, well, then you wait 1-1/2 hours for the counter to open.   And if you want a cup of coffee on this two hour flight, well, then you have to pay for it.  For a lousy cup of coffee.  I have platinum status with AA, so I do get to select my seats at booking with no extra cost, but if you do not have elite status, as you compare prices, for example between AA and BA, please remember that seat selection at BA can cost you hundreds of extra dollars on top of the quoted price.   I recently compared prices between United and BA for a Germany to PR round trip (business for the night flight, premium the other way), and BA came in at about $1000 less than United for three people.  So I booked BA, only to realize after booking that seat selection was not free, even in business class, and I wound up paying about $500 more in the end than United, which does not charge for seat selection.   Since I was booking for family with a young child, I didn't want to risk them not sitting together.... if you wait until 24 hours before the flight, at which time seat selection is free, who knows where you wind up.   Finally, not applicable to this flight, but BA business class on transatlantic flights does not have direct aisle access (I do understand that they have plans to upgrade their seats and configuration).  For now, you have to step over or be stepped over by the person next to you when the seat is extended to a bed.

We had to run to the Customer Service which refused to restore our original tickets because BA had already sold them! Frustrated and exhausted, we were forced to spend 8 hours at Heathrow after the overnight flight from IAD.
Worried that we would have the same experience on the way back to the U.S., we called BA Customer Service on October 28, one day before our departure from Milan to London asking a UK Customer Service Rep Rajeeve to change our flight at 2:15 PM to the earlier available flight at 11:10 AM so that we don't miss our connecting flight from Heathow to IAD at 4:30 PM, even if the flight from Milan arrives later that scheduled. Rajeeve assured us that it can be done for an extra fee and promised to call back and email a confirmation for a revised itinerary within an hour.  He did not call. We called Customer Service again. Another representative told us that Rajeeve made a mistake cancelling both legs of our flights instead of changing just one flight from Milan to London. He refused to connect us with manager but promised that the problem will be solved by the morning. One hour later Rajeeve called us and provided a new booking number for our flights. However, we were confused by a follow-up email from BA that was sent at 2 AM advising us to call Customer Service because we did not have any tickets any more! After a sleepless night, we arrived to the Milan airport early morning of October 29th hoping that BA solves the problem they created. We were denied boarding the 11:10 AM flight and informed over the phone by the UK Customer Service rep Ahmed that we had a standby status for our original flight at 2:15 PM.  The airport rep Marianna was understanding and helpful. She found two seats for us on the plane. Thanks to good pilots, the flight arrived on time to London and made it to the connecting flight to IAD. Overall, the experience of flying British Airlines was nerve wracking and exhausting. They did not care that their clueless customer representatives made mistakes which almost ruined our trip and never apologized. We will never do business with BA again and don't recommend it to anyone.",1.0,Washington DC,Venice,International,October 2023,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0
"Took a trip to Istanbul and was offered an upgrade to club Europe. The lounge at Heathrow was very nice, the flight out was great, good seats and decent lunch. However , I had booked extra legroom seats for my return journey and when I boarded was reseated  and was told that my extra leg room seats had been sold to club and I would have to get a refund. This is totally unacceptable,  I specifically wanted extra legroom and my return flight was awful. Cant believe BA would do this. Unlikely to use again unless I really had to. Can only assume that BA are doing this and other people are getting the same treatment..

"Was booked to travel from Milan to London and then on to Philadelphia.  The plane in Milan was delayed over 2 hours due to mechanical failure.  During the delay the customers were systematically lied to about the length of the delay and requests for rerouting were refused by agents at the gate.  We missed the connecting flight and did not get home until the following evening.

When the flight finally took off from Milan, the flight crew behaved in a surly, snappish, condescending manner, as if they were doing us a favor by ignoring the requests for information we made regarding connections, etc.  In the end, they resorted to outright lying to get us to shut up.  We were dumped into Heathrow without any guidance as to where to go or how to get help finding a connection.

We were later told by a BA employee that outside the UK, people who wear the BA uniform don't work for BA, but for a subcontractor or other company.  Whatever the corporate structure is, our experience was that from Italy to the UK you're on your own.  Once you get to the UK, if you are lucky enough to wander into a real BA agent, you may get the help you need.  But since we don't expect to need flights that remain totally within the UK in the future, we are not going to be flying BA again.  Something that we found out after the fact was that internationally, BA has a lousy reputation for reliability, to which I can definitely attest from experience.",1.0,Milan,London,Europe,October 2023,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0
"Dear customers, please please think twice before booking with BA Holidays. I have not travelled as yet, my holiday is due in Nov 23 unfortunately my spouse has fallen ill and has been admitted into hospital. 

BA wants to charge 50.00 each person to change the date of travel and 600.00 for hotel date change. 

To cancel its 900.00 for me to cancel  the holiday. For a family member to take my place and go with my  sister BA are charging 100.00 for a name change and the hotel could charge 500.00/600.00 just for a name change as they say am the lead person and the hotel has to change all their paper work. 
The BA staff  stated they won't hear from the hotel, Charmillion Club Resort until Tuesday. Bearing in mind the holiday was 797.00pp, such exagerated prices to make changes does not make sense and very poor customer care and retention

The staff on the phone said 'you agreed to this when signing up online for the holiday'.  To these exagerrated prices

We do have travel insurance but to know both the hotel and BA are working together to charge exaggerated prices when tragedy strikes customers  is very very poor customer service. 

Please do not be caught out by these terrible treatment of customers. Look else where to travel and find those tiny, tiny small prints they have stached somewhere in the miriads of written docs they have. Its really not worth the added stress going with BA, their policies of no compassion only adds to customers stress than alleviating it in times of serious illness of a loved one.

"STAY AWAY FROM BRITISH AIRWAYS.

This is the worst experience I've ever had.

Having paid close to £2200 for two tickets to Cape Town I went to check in online for our flight 24 hours before. To my surprise BA wanted us to pay to choose our seats. I nearly did it but thought, 'I'm not flying Ryanair, why the hell should I pay to choose my seat'. 

So, we didn't. When we got to the airport we were told our flight was oversold so we currently didn't have a seat & we had to go to the standby desk. 

At the standby desk I explained the reason for our trip, it is my best friends wedding. I was assured we were classed as urgent and they were doing everything they could.

After an hour waiting at the standby desk we were told they wanted us to go through. This, we were told made it highly likely we would be getting on the flight. We were concerned about our bags if we didn't get on but were assured we would be able to get them back if we didn't as they only went on after we had been confirmed seats. 

So we went through, literally raced to our gate to find another 25 people in the same situation. We had a 10 minute wait whilst they counted up the spare seats. 

In the end about 10 more got on and we weren't one of them. We were told a manager was coming to speak with us, only to be told by the same person 2 minutes later no one was coming. 

We decided to set off trying to get out which then resulted in us getting stuck, wandering the terminals by ourselves as there were no instructions or people to help.

When we eventually managed to make our way back to the BA desk in arrivals we were met by a team and their manager Hassan. 

Although very apologetic they did little in the way of trying to make up for our horrendous experience. 

Hassan told me that they were a business and there to make money, in the same breath he explained why someone who turned up after me got on the flight. They paid more for their ticket so got on. 

Profit before customer service. I think Mr Gallego has a way to go to make any of his below statement true.

At the same time, we will keep working towards our sustainability goals,' said CEO Luis Gallego.",1.0,London,Cape Town Central,International,October 2023,N/A,N/A,N/A,1.0,1.0,N/A,N/A,N/A

So the crew couldn't leave the aircraft until the porters returned with a Airport wheelchair in order to get him to a buggy -

I asked the security staff in the passport hall if they could try to find my husband, they said no, they don't do things like that.  He wasn't answering his phone (both our batteries were dying as we'd waited so long at the aircraft door).

"While traveling in the old club world with its impossibly narrow and convoluted seats was a dubious pleasure, British Airways has quietly developed into a top airline.

Clearly the lounge in London really needs a refresh, some of the furniture is pretty shabby and not all of the power outlets work. The new toilet concept with the abolition of gender-segregated toilets and the introduction of mixed toilets is nonsense: Waiting times have increased massively for everyone. 
Cateringwise there is an extensive range of food and an even more extensive range of drinks.

Checking in, including all controls, went very quickly, as did boarding. The ambience in the 787 was elegant, beautiful lighting effects, the seat is really premium. For us as a family with 2 little children, the seating arrangement is not ideal, but it was possible to choose seats in the middle row. The only downer is that you have to pay around CHF 100.00 per person and flight to choose your seat. One pays enough for the ticket, skip this additional tax!!

The service was very attentive and polite, the drinks offered were also very good, and the food was really great. As a Swiss you measure everything by the Swiss, BA can easily keep up with the food and far exceeds it when it comes to seats.

"My husband and I recently travelled to Croatia.  BA was 55 minutes late arriving to JFK,  which caused us to miss our connecting flight to Croatia at Gatwick.  When we arrived at Gatwick we had to go through customs again because they had eliminated the transfer area for people who were flying through.  We were told that there were no more flights to Dubrovnik that day, unless we took transport to Heathrow.  They gave us a vouchers for a bus transfer, but the bus transfer station attendant stated that we would not have gotten to Heathrow on time, so we were advised by the BA clerk to take a cab to Heathrow,  which cost $177.

My husband and I had to run through terminal C to get to gate 36 (which of course was almost the furthest gate).  I am completely dissatisfied with BA.  Their business class seats are uncomfortable, and the only difference from economy seating is that they do not put a person in the middle seat.  The legroom on the flight from Croatia was terrible.

"We had an amazing tome in Santorini- our return flight was cancelled There was not ONE representative in Santorini airport that could represent your company or support us. Not one person could rebook or reimburse us. I am in complete awe with British Airways response to this. The  representative that we spoke to over the phone , after waiting for 2 hours to get someone on the phone and almost a day of attempting to get back to the states, never gave us a refund option.  Hence, the rebooking  option was for September 1, 2023. Not only was it an absurd  amount of time to wait to get home, we all have jobs and responsibilities to report to, but most importantly,  my youngest daughter DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH INSULIN to last her 3 days! The insulin she needs every time she eats to keep her alive.  At this point we were  stranded on the island abroad with no help.  Scurrying  to find  another flight to get us home should not have been something we had to do. We were left to figure this out on our own. This  was something your company obligated to resolve and neglected to. Moreover, the representative on the phone made it clear, that she could not help us, and the only choice we had was September 1st. Your company gave us no other option but to spend $10,0000 on a one way flight! I did not have $10,000 to get us home. This money I had to borrow from my father on his credit card, which I will need to repay in addition to interest rates. I am  not asking for British Airways to give me more than what I spent. It is repugnant, distasteful and offensive that British Airways has decided not to put their customers first, and that a beautiful trip to Santorini would mow cost us $20,000 dollars. 

BA also mentioned that refund was processed for our original return flight, however, It has not been.

"I fly BA on average 2 / 3 times per month for work and pleasure, and there are a few things I think should be known about BA for anyone using this service:

First : I cannot remember the last time a flight took off on time, with delays of +1 hr (often announced after boarding) a regular occurrence. 

For anyone on connecting flight that change at specifically at Heathrow you should beware that there is usually a delay in exiting the aircraft too and I often see a chaotic line of people at terminal 5 who missed their connecting flight and have a lengthy wait ahead of them for a new one. 

BA customer service is also something you must not rely on. An example of this is when I forgot to pick up a bag from the baggage reclaim and only realised just as I walked through the arrivals gate. The lady at the baggage service counter in Heathrow Terminal 5 mentioned it would only take 10 mins - but I then had to wait for over an hour and a half to retrieve the bag, the reason she gave me was because the person she asked to get the bag then went on a break and turned his mobile phone off.  
Another example is when BA cancelled my flight and moved it to one 24 hrs later (despite there being earlier flights) this meant I would miss another flight I booked with BA the next morning, however they would not offer to change or refund that flight as it was booked under a separate booking. This resulted in me having to pay £650 for a new flight from Munich to london. 

The only reason I continue to use the service is because they have a large number of flight routes and a points scheme that I benefit from. However I am now reviewing this along with others at my company to find alternatives.",1.0,Munich,London,Europe,October 2023,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0

"I will start with apologies that I bother you but I can’t pass by. Me and my partner, we travel a lot and unfortunately it was the worst travel experience of my and my partner life’s. It was started bad from the beginning. The 24th august we received an e-mail that our connection flight from London to Brussels was cancelled and they booked a new one but 4 hours later and in economic class not business as we booked, as it was our connection we had to wait at the airport. The flight from Nassau to London we had bad experience too. The seat of Gregory Pinnoy (my partner) was terribly dirty because I guess the passenger before us vomited and they didn’t clean properly. The stewardess wasn’t helpful at all, she just cleaned a bit with little wet napkin, we continued to clean it ourselves as it was impossible to travel in the stinky dirty seat. Afterward I found that my “sleeping bag” was used and I even found the dirty socks of someone inside. The stewards didn’t have a new one, they just brought a little blanket and it was a night flight so it is useful to have a big drap. After arriving in London about 12 o clock we went to customer service to check with them why it is economic, after waiting about an hour, they told us that the business is full and can’t do anything. We went to south lounge to wait till 18h35 where they informed us that the flight that was booked for 4 hours later is cancelled too and no any other news, we also received an e-mail with this cancellation. It was about 2 pm. They told us to go to the customer service in lounge so we did directly. In the customer service they told us to wait as they don’t know anything and can’t help us and that we will receive new e-mail with the instructions. No any news within 2 hours. After that: about 4 pm, we were started to checking with customer service for any news. Always the same answer that we have to wait.

We have booked a business classe for all our 4 return flights.

"Contacted BA call centre to change a flight within the 24 hr cooling off period. Couldn't fully understand agent due to accent, background noise and my hearing's not the best. Asked about changing prepaid seats and I'm sure he said wait till refund and revised flight go through. OK so far. Later noticed new flight was confirmed but no e tickets issued. Called again but foolishly mention the 'refund' word and entered a rabbit hole of pain. 
I've since spoken to numerous agents in different countries. Some are quietly spoken and others rattle off like a machine gun. In six weeks, all the agents have escalated my concerns and want to listen to my original call but nothings been done. One agent even told me I'd lost my original booking because I'd cancelled and would need to pay again in full. The offshore call centre staff seem more worried about  blame than fast resolution and customer satisfaction. Only today did I speak to an agent who calmly explained that new tickets would be sent out but there was a small fare difference to pay. Up until this point I thought it was an erroneous admin charge. I agreed  but it couldn't be done immediately and I would be contacted within 72 hrs. Finally I'm almost there. 
Tips: don't mention more than one problem in any one call.
           don't expect email contact when promised.
           don't expect to speak to the same agent.
           don't be afraid to say 'I can't understand you' or 'please slow down'
           do have all your paperwork to hand and be ready for an agent to call 
           at any time.

Apparently lights are supposed to be checked prior to flights but clearly that doesn’t happen. Appreciate it’s not a major issue but does make you wonder what else they don’t do maintenance on…
The much advertised food service was terrible. Ran out of sandwiches and juice (apparently only 8 sets of sandwiches provided for the inbound and 8 for outbound). Given the relative lack of decent food outlets at Paphos this seems inadequate and if there’s a reason why only 8 people could get sandwiches, why not advise passengers to pick up something in the airport? I had noodles which were revolting! 
To finish off the experience one of our bags failed to appear at Gatwick and there were no staff to be found and no way of logging the lost bag. Not what I expect from what used to be a reasonable airline",2.0,Paphos,London,Europe,October 2023,2.0,2.0,N/A,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0

"I am trying to not make this personal, or a vendetta against them. This is an honest review about British airways and I have been a loyal Gold Member with 17000 lifetime tier points.
I’ve defended them during the cyber hack when I was hacked. They have some amazing staff, who really care.
But when I read the complaints 10k terrible reviews out of 58,000 and another 8,000 very poor, and they don’t even respond, this tells you how they value you. You’re the customer. You hold the aces. You can vote with your wallet. 
Their service to me has been 2 good flights, 1 bad one. From first class to business I’ve endured appalling service, cancelled flights, incompetent staff. I cannot list all because it’s literally thousands of words. Sean Doyle does not respond. Check his LinkedIn page where he has not responded to a single complaint. Maybe he (or his team do) separately. But they have now as a whole become arrogant and profit driven with no customer care. The gold helpline is worthless. Even hung up on two weeks ago after you cancelled our flight due to a technical fault (you rarely actually tell us why there is a fault but Gemma, and I will say both Gemma and Candi at Heathrow did everything they could and apologised for the appalling treatment at guest services confirmed this), and have thus requested gdpr on the phone call and I’ve shared the name with my complaint - oh and why did we call, because after eventually being 17 hours late on our big family holiday, you cancelled the return flights because you didn’t update our booking!!!! To say it was a comedy of errors doesn’t do it justice. 

Oh and to slightly backtrack, the auto generated new flight was 36 hours later!!!! There were 3 with Cathay Pacific which they could have booked! He said it wasn’t possible to do, so how did guest services manage to fix it - why because you messed up badly and lied to us (sorry, misinformed!)

22 days gone before this is raised to the ICO and CAA. They realise that many of us will complain a little on here, but most of us do nothing. We spent 2 hours dealing with the most incompetent person at check in lane j12 in the first wing, and took 2 hours to get a flight we didn’t want and his response was ‘that’s the way it is’. It’s all clearly on camera if BA want to have a look. We somehow stayed as calm as we could after being brushed off - and then told by the guest services team in the lounge that we no doubt were ‘misinformed’. Well that’s just taking it lightly. 

A company which decided to lay off 12,000 dedicated staff during covid - ie. The business put profits over their most important asset, told me everything and the service is shown. As I say, I’ve come across some amazing people, Candi and Gemma at Heathrow guest services after a recent disgraceful situation which we are still appearing to be dealt with contempt. Check out trust pilot - 1 star, thousands of complaints. I don’t understand why not one single response. Total silence. This is how they think of us. The nobodies. Well these nobodies put the food on your table. There are for the most part so many 
alternatives, albeit some also have failed but there are great other airlines and I hope all of us, the thousands who have not just been let down, but truly failed by the British airways company, and their always generic weak unheralded responses when they respond via customer relations. I shall vote with my wallet as I say, il enjoy the lounge with the odd flight and companion voucher I have left, I’ve cancelled my Amex BA credit card, as has my partner. The more that do it, the more they might realise how bad they truly are. 
I hope someone high up reads this, but as we’ve seen they don’t. Twitter is useless too. Generic, please message by DM, as so to not give them more bad press. No customer service rep has any power anymore, and same on flights when you could get given avios as an apology for broken seats or compensation. 

Shame on you British airways - but this is to the management. There are some incompetent useless staff members but I will say, there are some great people there but I cannot defend how I’ve been personally ‘customer’

"I flew BA from Frankfurt to Heathrow.  According to my Manage My Booking, check in opens at 5 am, which would be correct for the first flight of the day but for my flight, in fact check in did not open until around 7:50 am, a bit more than 2 1/2 hrs before flight time of 10:35 am.

I had VAT refund to claim so had my luggage tagged and then walked over to the Customs export desk with my luggage to get my VAT refund forms stamped and then to the Global Blue counter next to the customs desk to get my refund.  I was lucky that there was no line up at either, plenty of customs officers on duty, and I was done within a couple of minutes.  However be warned that when I checked late afternoon the day before, there was a decent line up of about 30 people at the customs desk and only two officers working so getting your VAT refund could certainly take much longer than a couple of minutes. 

Frankfurt airport separates passport control and security with security inspections conducted at the gates.  I was quickly through passport control by 8:18 am and walked to the lounge passing the security check area for Gates D1-D4 from which my flight would depart and there was no line up at all for security.  However, later on when I returned from using the lounge at around 9:17 am for my 10:35 am flight, there was a huge line for security check for Economy that stretched almost to the entrance of the lounge at Gate D5.  I was able to use the Business Class line which was only a few people long but even that line was very slow and it took about 20 minutes to get through security.  

BA does not have its own lounge at Frankfurt and uses the Japan Airlines Sakura lounge.  The lounge is located next to Gate D5.  Surprisingly but a pleasant surprise to me, the lounge was still implementing pandemic prevention measures.  There were plastic dividers between most seats and food was not self-serve.  Instead there was staff behind a counter that would put together the food according to your order from 8 choices like American breakfast, croissant and jam, ham & cheese set, or vegan bowl.  Service in the lounge was excellent, staff were constantly going through the lounge clearing glasses and dishes and all staff still wore masks. 

Boarding for my flight was supposed to be at 9:55 am so when the departures board was still showing the gate as not open at 9:15 am, I decided to head for the gate knowing I would have to pass through security at the gate as mentioned before. I was through security by 9:38 am and found that the seating area for Gate D1 was still not opened yet, with passengers standing outside the area.  Around 9:46 am gate staff showed up to let passengers into the seating area and promptly at 9:55 am boarding started.  I noticed a lot of passengers arrived at the aircraft after 10:15 am short of breath from running, all saying that the security line was extremely long and took a long time.  I think the gate staff did what they could to wait and the door was not closed until 9:28 am for the 9:35 am flight.  One passenger went up to the cabin attendants and explained that his travelling companions were stuck at security and just made it to the gate after the gate closed, but there was nothing that could be done since the airbridge was retracted already. There was a long wait for the pushback team and a long taxi so the flight did not pushback until 10:56 am and takeoff was 11:13 am.  Fortunately flight time was short so the flight arrived on time at Heathrow despite the delays.

The flight was operated with an A320 and there was no difference between the Club Europe seats and the economy seats except that the middle seat was left empty in the Club Europe section.  Despite the short flight time, there was a quick meal service on the flight with a choice of two cold salads – chicken with beans or squash.  I had the squash salad and it was pretty good for a quick meal.  Service was excellent since there were two cabin attendants taking care of 10 passengers in Club Europe. 

Overall it was a good short haul flight.  The cabin attendants were friendly and attentive, the quick meal was good, and we were on time despite various delays on departure.",5.0,Frankfurt,London,Europe,October 2023,4.0,4.0,N/A,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0
"British airways is honestly the worst airline in the world, words can't describe the incompetency of this company. I grew up in antigua and my family still lives there so I fly over multiple times a year and every time I fly now, there is a problem. I booked my flight and wanted to add an extra bag, as my father isn't well and need some stuff that you can't get over there. I've never had a problem adding bags before, but for some reason, despite claiming their stupid website (worst website in the world!) can add bags ,it can't, so you have to ring their customer service, who half the time you can't get through too! When I rung to add bags, they claim I can't add them because my first flight is aer Lingus. This is a booked through ticket, that I have flown probably 100 times in my life and I have always been able to add bags and have never had to go through aer Lingus. I explained this to the incompetent staff at their call centre but was told they couldn't help. I went back on their joke of a website, to assign my seat and saw there was an upgrade available, so I went on to do it and lo and behold it says it can't be done on the website and to ring their customer service!!! Which I do so again, and apparently the upgrade is gone. Fine so I ask for them again to add a bag and told no, so I said can I assign my seat then, apparently I can't do that either, I need to contact aer Lingus. Tried to book a seat online, it says there is no seats available on the flight!!!!! Just to clarify, I did call aer lingus, despite already knowing the answer and the woman couldn't believe the laziness and incompetency of BA and asked how she was expected to add bags and assign seats on a completely different airline! I am livid, there is only one way to get to antigua from where I am, so it's not like I have other options in order to avoid flying with them. British airways, you are an embarrassment, your customer service, your airline and your staff are a joke.

BA service I received is absolutely disgraceful! I had a flight booked and confirmed back to UK from Nairobi. I was one of the first three people in the queue at check in. I was advised I've been out on standby and would not be getting on the flight because BA overbooked. Long story short I was advised I have to get on a flight 24hrs later. When asked what do I do now I was asked to wait. I waited from 6pm until 12.30am in the airport for the staff to arrange somewhere for me to stay. I asked if I could go sit in a lounge as I had been waiting but I was told to wait or go find a seat in the airport. I asked for water as it was a hot country and there were no shops inside the airport to buy a drink...I was told we can't provide this. So you left me standing for over 6 hours with no seat or water. Now I have tried to claim compensation which I was advised to do by the BA staff I have not heard from BA for two months despite contacting them several times and asking for an update on my claim. I was advised call back next week if you don't hear anything but I should get an email...I didn't hear back. I called customer service and they keep telling me they can't do anything.,1.0,Nairobi,London,International,August 2023,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

"Absolutely awful post trip. M jumbo bag was damaged when I picked it up in Prague.The outer zipper was gone and contents had spilled out. As a result, a sandal was lost. However, I made the claim for luggage only, OVER 3 months ago. I spoke with a rep in Prague, called British Air from Prague, then made a report at the office in Seattle, all as I was told to do. I have e-chatted ( no other option) 12 times. Finally I was directed by a ticket agent that I called (bless him) to fill out a different form. That I did. Received a response req fill out more info. Done.No response. So after sending another form, I received an email stating they would pay repairs to send them the bill. However, where I live does not offer a luggage repair service, and I have tried several places that I would have to send it to Seattle and have it sent back to me which would cost more than the luggage. I have also had to go out and purchase another bag for a trip overseas because it’s been as I said over three months since this was originally reported.

"Delighted to share our recent travel experience with British Airways! Set off extremely excited on October 7th from Cork Airport for our week in Mumbai.  Flight from Cork was on time and we arrived in Heathrow with plenty of time to explore T5.

Upon reaching Heathrow Terminal 5 for our 5pm Mumbai flight, we observed a challenging noteworthy situation at the boarding gate, where a couple had encountered difficulties on the flight before ours.  A couple missed their flight, stemming from their lounge overstay.  They were extremely rude to the lady  at the  boarding desk  however , despite the testing circumstances, the BA employee remained composed and handled the situation with grace.  Something I found difficult witnessing the situation myself.

During our boarding process, a visa complication arose for my husband, requiring swift action. This same lady assisted my husband and whilst it was an extremely worrying time for us her calm and kind manner helped in the situation.  Although due to an error (one number out on visa) my husband was unable to board and our holiday dreams dashed, this lady's kind demeanor and at times witty attitude  alleviated the situation, and for that, we are sincerely grateful.

The real standout occurred at the ticketing desk when we had to rebook (hopefully we can get babysitters again!)   to Ms. A Khan and Ms. N Barry at the ticketing desk, who demonstrated unparalleled professionalism, empathy and care in rebooking our tickets. Facing the disruption of our holiday plans our moods had soured however their efforts made a significant difference, turning a challenging situation into a positive experience.  To be honest the 3 ladies (Didn't get the other ladies name) at the ticketing desk were by any measure simply the best customer focused employees I have ever encountered. Their empathy, professionalism and customer focus displayed the type of employees that any company would be blessed to have working for them.  

It says alot about British airways that every employee we met that day from boarding gate, ticketing desk, baggage (issues with finding bag after it had to be removed from plane), was absolutely exceptional and went out of their way, above and beyond to turn what was a very disappointing circumstance into a bearable one.  

Looking forward to our rescheduled flight in October with optimism (still scrambling for replacement babysitters lol!) , hoping for smooth travels and encountering the same friendly faces at British Airways.

"The only decent thing about BA is the cabin crew, everything else about BA is TERRIBLE. Firstly the price of the tickets. I had a companion voucher to use as part of my credit card, trying to book anywhere with the voucher is extremely difficult. Once you finally find a flight that you can actually use it on that has availability, you then have to use most of your points and some money towards the flight also. Considering our flight was circa 2 hours long each way, using a companion voucher, 20,000 points and £35 is a JOKE. 
Once we had boarded our flight, we were sat on the plane at the terminal for quite a while. Once our flight had landed at Bologna we were informed by the captain that the reason for the delay is because he was having an argument with operations regarding loading our bags onto the plane. He then proceeded to tell us the outcome was that the majority of bags were not loaded onto the plane. Considering BA were aware of this before we even departed, I was completely outraged that no one from BA had tried to contact us or even sent us an email. I reported the bag as lost and then heard absolutely nothing until 24 hours later. This ruined our whole trip as we were not staying in Bologna and had hired a car to drive south. We had to go to Primark and buy some replacement clothes as we had no idea when the bag would turn up. A few hours later we get a message (not from BA) to say that our bag is ready for collection from Bologna airport, to which we rushed there and had to wait approximately 2 hours to actually get the bag.
Upon return from our s**t show of a holiday, I logged a complaint to which I constantly got automated replies. I have logged a baggage claim to recuperate the costs of the emergency clothes we had to buy but have not been responded to and my complaint case has been closed by BA but it has not been resolved.

On top of that, the replacement flight was crowded since everyone from the cancelled flight had to be squished into that plane.

"OK, so we flew BA as part of a package holiday through TUI, however we were not impressed with the service 

The flights we were on had Euro Traveller and Club Europs cabins on them, we were not offered an upgrade to this at all when we booked, nor when we reserved our seats 

Seeing these cabins on the outbound leg I decided to try and upgrade us for the trip home

I spoke to TUI who said it had to be done through the Rep on site, saw her but she said speak to BA so after being told by BA on Saturday that our flight had all its Club Europe available we were also told that TUI had to sort the upgrade SOMEONE TAKE MY MONEY!!! 

So after some more calls to TUI they said we should be able to do it after check in, through BA, so we checked in and called BA, guess what.. No we cannot upgrade you, all the seats have been reserved, and anyway TUI need to do it, but you can't anyway as they are all sold

So we admitted defeat, despite us willing to pay good hard cash for the cabin upgrade. 

Boarded today coming home, and my god, they had moved all the families up to CE from the back, literally for free, when I was offering to pay good money for the product 

During the flights themselves we sat in row 13 on way out, and 12 on way back, on the outbound leg in 13 my wife had a toddler kicking her seat back most of the way, on the way back today in row 12, no such issues

"Tuesday 29th August and we were travelling on board British Airways Flight BA0837 from 
Dublin Airport to London Heathrow.

We were Due to depart at 15.35 and arrive 17.00 a scheduled eighty-five flight. We discovered that our flight was delayed until 15.50.

We commenced boarding at 15.20, by walking out to the aircraft, this process was 
completed at 15.50, the rescheduled departure time. The aircraft pushed back at 16.05 and finally airborne at 16.20 which was forty-five minutes later than originally scheduled.

We were travelling in Club Europe Class, so we were expecting a similar seating arrangement as our outbound flight on the Wednesday 23rd August. Then we had three seats between two of us, the centre seat was filled in so that we could use it as a table. All very comfortable and plenty of legroom as expected in Club Europe.

On this occasion, as we boarded the aircraft we saw there was a person sitting in the centre seat, not what we expected. Also it meant we were not sitting together. We were not informed about this when we checked in.

Spoke we the Team Manager, who informed us that the Airline were trying to transport as many people as possible, following the chaos caused by the recent computer failure and Air Traffic Control issues. Accepted that explanation but was not happy as we were not getting the service we paid for, despite the Cabin Manager's platitudes.

The person sitting in the middle seat kindly moved so that we could sit together.

The Captain did announce that the flight time would be fifty minutes 

As part of the Cabin service we were offered a Cream tea, consisting of a finger sandwich, slice of cake and a scone with cream and jam, we declined. This was followed by a drink, we had started our descent before this was offered 

There was not much legroom, our knees touched the seat in front. The seats were not very wide and the padding was hard,.

It was not helped that the child seating behind continually kicked the seat, despite asking it's parents to stop it, who turned aggressive and nasty.

We landed at 17.10, which was only ten minutes late despite earlier. Thankfully it was only a short flight, we so pleased to get off in Heathrow.

Since the flight we have contacted BA Customer Services and they have made a gesture to compensate us. A kind gesture but it does not erase the experience.",1.0,Dublin,London,Europe,August 2023,1.0,1.0,N/A,1.0,1.0,N/A,1.0,2.0
"First time flying BA. We had 4 flights and all were late with the exception of our flight back to canada. Thats the one we needed to be late as BA were late getting us into into Heathrow for our connecting flight to Canada.One by flight was late by 5 hours.  They gave us a hotel and meal vouchers. However at the hotel we were told ' British Airways stranded passengers need to eat at the back of the resturant in a separate room' . They said we were not 'VIP ' . There was no service at the ' back of the dining room '. Just a mediocre buffet with water. Same for breakfast. 
No wheelchaie service was provided after I had booked this for my mom.After two hours in the airport waiting I found a stray wheelchair and pushed my mom to the hotel bus myself, juggling luggage.
They booked us on a flight the next day to Montreal.
We booked premium economy. Definitely not worth the extra cost on BA . Book bulkhead seats instead. You will have more leg room.The premium economy seats provided no extra room.They were very uncomfortable and the recline didnt work on either my seat or my mom's . No apologies were made.

Cancelled my flight due to war breaking out and all government advice to not travel to the region.  BA charges $150 cancellation charge + $40 cancellation fee.

"Booked & paid for extra legroom seats on outbound and inbound flights due to my husband being 6ff 4” and me having a disability. 
checked in online only to board the plane and find out we didn’t have extra legroom seats & to be told their is no such thing unless you are a British Airways member. 
Why had I paid for extra leg room & clarified this in a phone call with BA customer services prior to flying if they don’t provide this seating option.
The journey there was very uncomfortable to say the least. 
On our inbound flight I tried to check in online 24 hrs before departure and was advised online checking wasn’t available to me & I had to check in at the airport, 
We arrived at the airport 3 hrs before our departure to ensure we got sat together on the plane due to my disability as we hadn’t been able to check in online. The gentleman at check in said he had to make a phone call as there was a problem with our tickets hence why we couldn’t check in online ourselves, he said this happened a lot and could we stand to one side with our luggage whilst he received a phone call confirming the problem had been sorted.
We were called back over an hour later after nearly all the flight had checked in to be told now we were sat apart as all other seats had been taken. 
Under the circumstances which were not our fault we tried to complain to be told no British airways staff were located in the airport snd we were given the complaints tel no 
I am disabled and rely on my husband to look after me. I didn’t have any choice but to sit on my own and felt extremely vulnerable. Anxious & embarrassed all the way home. 
We have since complained and have received a generic apology email in response. There is no contact tel number to speak with a human & if you reply to there email you just receive a different genetic worded apology

"The only saving Grace for the terrible service BA offers to its customers is the check in, that also, because the young girl at the counter was 6 days into her work.  The business class lounge at terminal 5 (in London/Heathrow) was crowded, food was well below par, they had stacked up on free wines (as if it was a casino), the lounge was dirty, the sofas were stained.  The gate check-in was full of really rude and clueless staff, waffling is natural to them.  The plane ride is an event and a half, Premier Economy class is worse than all available option among several airlines which offer the same, it has no value for money (VfM). The seats are small, recline is obstructed, the entertainment system is faulty at best, the food (that is if any is left, as in my case they had run out of choice options till they got to 19 Alpha) is terrible, the coffee is once again sandy and muddy. The crew is monotone and 'not polite' they are not rude, but they give a feeling of as being ' why am I here and why should I be helping you'.  Getting into London/Heathrow, they parked us next to the gate with tube but made us and all (elderly and wheelchair bound folks) go down the stairs and up the stairs (felt like we-willie-winkie) - auxiliary power was not working so taking off from London the plane was a baking unit (very hot and uncomfortable).  The luggage handling is slow.

I had upgraded to Premium Economy and paid additionally for seat selection. The seat was decently located on the aisle for easy access to the restrooms and on the top deck which has 2-3-2 seating.

"Booked a very special holiday for me and my partner, September arrived and we were on our way to lovely south of France, Booked Business Class for us both to start the holiday right. 
as we were checking I was told the flight was over booked and our seats wouldn't print onto the ticket for some reason. 
We had already made sure the seats were booked when we had booked the flights nearly a year prior to going. 
Unfortunately when we arrived at the gate we was then told we would no longer be sat together and one of us would in fact have to go into economy. 
My girlfriend is an extremely nervous flyer and so had to take extra tablets to remain calm, She didnt have any food which we had pre booked also and she was sat right down the bottom end of the flight.
We were held at the gate with another 4 or 5 couples all in the same predicament all due to the lovely money grabbing British airways over booking the flight. 

They ended up refusing passengers in the end and even had people sat on the fold down chairs in the toilet area. 

when we eventually arrived in France late, we was waiting for our luggage to come. 
Our airtags stated that both our cases was infact still in Heathrow. 
We then had to wait 4 days for them to eventually come into France by this point our holiday was ruined. 

British airways was absolutely shocking, we couldn't speak to anyone as all the phone numbers were no longer in use.
We felt stranded in a foreign country with no clothes and no one to help use with what to do next. 

Every day we watched them case not moved as we were tracking with air tags. 
it was so frustrating not being able to plan our days in hope we would get the call to then drive all the way back to the air port 2 hours each way to collect our cases. 

we ended up going out and buying new clothes toiletries and all the stuff to make the best of our ruined holiday, saving all the receipts thinking we would be able to claim it all back. 

how wrong I was. 
British airways take zero responsibility and fob me off with going through my insurance. 

British airways only pay for basic essentials, Pants and toothpaste. 

I filed a complaint when I got back and requested my money back for business class and they haven't even had the decency to even respond. 

They are an absolute joke of a company and I wish they would remove British out of there name because there is nothing British about them.

"I flew on BA84 from Vancouver to London Heathrow with a connection at Terminal 5 onto Frankfurt.  I had been checking flight status on my flight in the days leading to my departure and noted that almost every day, the flight was delayed, sometimes by as much as 3 hours.  As I feared, my flight was delayed due to late departure of the Heathrow to Vancouver flight and its late arrival in Vancouver by about an hour.  As a result, my flight departure was delayed from 8:55 pm to 9:48 pm as BA advised in an e-mail to me.   I was therefore glad that I had left over 3 hours for my connection at Heathrow. I believe the issue is with BA scheduling rather than Heathrow airport delays as the Air Canada flight to Heathrow departing around the same time was on time.  

I arrived at the airport to check in at around 6 pm, and there was no line up to check in at the Club World counter.  British Airways closed its own lounge and has been using the Plaza Premium lounge.  However that lounge is currently under renovation, so I was directed to the temporary space for Plaza Premium which was just an open cordoned off area near Gate 67.  To its credit, Plaza Premium did have pretty much the same hot and cold food offerings at the temporary space as they used to have in their real lounge but of course the open space did not have as much seating, there were few places where one could plug into an outlet to work, and it was paper plates and cups and disposable wood cutlery, so not much ambiance. The signage was not great and its location in the open meant frequently passengers would come into the space thinking it was some kind of deli kiosk or store rather than a lounge.  The lounge staff were great and worked hard to keep food well stocked and to clear off and clean tables. 

My boarding pass indicated the boarding time would be 8:45 pm so I proceeded to the gate around that time. Gate staff advised boarding would be more like 9 pm but they were still waiting for the flight and cabin crew to arrive. A few of the cabin crew arrived shortly after I got to the gate but the flight crew and the bulk of the cabin crew did not arrive at the gate until a couple of minutes after 9 pm.  I heard a passenger complain to gate staff that we should not be delayed from boarding by the crew.  I do not know whether it was related to the relatively late arrival of the flight and cabin crew to the gate or whether there were other issues but we did not push back until 10:17 pm, more than an hour and twenty minutes after the scheduled departure time and a much greater delay than the delayed arrival of the inbound flight. 

The flight was operated with an A350-1000 with the new Club Suite in Club World with the individual privacy doors.  The cabin was configured with 1x2x1 seating and every seat had direct aisle access.  This is my first time in a Club Suite and I liked the seat a lot.  It is certainly a big improvement on BA’s long dated and much criticized front and back facing Club World seats where most window seat passengers had to climb over the feet of the neighbouring passenger to reach the aisle.  The seat had small shallow storage areas in the counter next to the window and a taller cabinet storage area for the toiletries kit and water bottle.  The table pulls out from under the video screen and then can fold out to quite a large table.  The armrest on the aisle side can be lowered to be flat with the seat cushion. The privacy door is locked in the open position for take off but once we reached cruising altitude, the doors are unlocked and one can manually close the door fully or partially.  When seated upright, I can peer over the door to see the other seats but once I recline my seat, the door blocks all view of the other seats and gives a great feeling of privacy.  I noticed especially when I have the seat in bed position, with the privacy door closed I am not disturbed at all by the flickering light from other passengers’ video screens.  The seat is most definitely a game changer for me as to how I pick BA flights to fly on, and I will certainly try to arrange my long haul travel to be on flights with the Club Suite product. 

On scanning around my seat, I noted that cleaning was not very thorough.  I could see some cookie or bread crumbs on my window side armrest and when I swiped on the touch screen video screen I could feel some bits of things stuck on the screen eventhough I had wiped down the screen and my seat with alcohol wipes. 

The other thing I noticed is that the service routine seems to have been reduced a bit.  There was no pre-ordering of in flight meals on-line.  There was no particular greeting of Executive Club Gold members from the in flight services director or purser like there used to be before the pandemic, and the practice of taking meal orders first from Gold members (to ensure they get their preferred choice) and of serving their meals in priority have also disappeared from the service routine. 

Welcome drinks were promptly offered on boarding and then meal orders were taken.  Everyone gets a farro salad, and then you choose one of three starters, one of three main courses and one of three desserts.  I did not realize I could only choose one starter as previously I used to order both a soup and an appetizer so I asked for both the soup and the smoked salmon.  The cabin attendant was very nice and said she would check and if they have extra, there would be no problem with having both the soup and the smoked salmon. I chose the pan seared beef tenderloin for my main course and it was a bit hard and tough to cut.  Perhaps the hour plus delay to flight time affected optimal food quality.  My starter roasted red pepper soup was fine, and the smoked salmon was the salmon candy kind. My New York cheesecake dessert was not memorable.  Overall dinner on the flight was probably a little less good compared to my flight experience in the couple of years before the pandemic when BA made a concerted effort to improve its Club World catering and succeeded quite well in my opinion.  They seem to have taken a step back though.  

There was a bit of confusion on the pre-dinner drinks.  Drinks were promptly brought out but the packs of nuts that should be accompanying did not arrive until most people had finished their drinks so perhaps cabin crew forgot.

For the pre-arrival breakfast, BA actually came up with the best breakfast I have had on BA in quite some time.  Instead of the previous routine hot back bacon roll, this flight offered an excellent beef pastrami panini which was toasted just right and crunchy, and was delicious!

For sleeping onboard, BA continues to offer a bedding pack from The White Company with a nice warm comforter and a very thin seat pad that did not seem to make much difference other than to disguise the fold points of the seat.  In bed position, the Club Suite bed is very comfortable, has good width at the shoulder level eventhough the window side armrest cannot be lowered and only the aisle side armrest can be lowered, and has excellent length.

BA still has the Club Kitchen set-up in the galley between meals. There was wine, pop, water and juices, and snacks like chips, nuts and shortbread cookies. They no longer have the sandwiches and salads they used to have. 

BA has a good selection of movies on its entertainment system, including a fair amount of non-Hollywood studio offerings, so it was nice to see something different.  However, I have never liked the Airbus system as the controls are a lot harder to use than the Boeing system if I wanted to fast forward or scroll back. 

The plane was not able to make up any time in flight so the flight arrived about 1 hr and 15 minutes late.  Fortunately I was connecting Terminal 5 to Terminal 5, was able to use the Fast Track lane, and was able to get through passport control and security within about 30 minutes after the flight landed even with my carry-on having been selected for secondary inspection.  I was fine with the delay since I had left myself more than 3 hours to connect but someone following BA’s minimum connection time of 1 hour for same terminal connections and who did not have Fast Track access would probably have been scrambling. 

Overall a good flight due to the new Club Suite physical product, food a little disappointing and seems there are several service cutbacks. Be warned the poor on-time record for this particular flight makes it a worrisome flight to use for any same day connections at Heathrow.",4.0,Vancouver,London,International,September 2023,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

This is the worst airway I’ve ever experienced. When I got to the  Heathrow airport (1.5 hours late) i was told i was not allowed to try to make my connecting flight to Glasgow and had to rebook. When i went to rebook they made everyone get out of line and said they weren’t rebooking. Real helpful. Then when i finally got in another line I got a notification i wouldn’t be taking off til 8 pm. Mind you i was supposed to take off at 8:40 am… upon telling customer service what was happening they said nothing helpful and didn’t even put me in stand by.

We got onboard and even though the plane has been sat on the tarmac for 2 hours BEFORE we boarded the business class seats were filthy from the previous passengers!

The baby shelf in the bathroom hadn’t been cleaned in weeks, it was full of dust! And the food was rather lackluster. 

I mentioned to the cabin crew about not getting the seats we had paid for and she told me to take it up with BA customer service when I was back in the UK. 

On our return, I contacted BA customer services who told me, as I had returned there was nothing they could do! Nice scam you have taking peoples money for services you have failed to provide.

Very uncomfortable experience. Boarding at Heathrow was an absolute shambles. On board my seat back was defective in that it kept collapsing backward. The menu listed Lamb which was unavailable when the attendant reached our seat. My wife's headphones only worked for as long as she pressed the plug in with her knee. Our departure was delayed for a few 'engineering problems 'which had to be attended to before takeoff. This certainly does not inspire confidence.

"Nothing much good to say about the flight or the Airbus A380-841 BA configuration. 
Flight was delayed take off from Chicago by 20 minutes then add on 15 minutes taxi-ing. Travelling Economy seat 38A was definitely a bad choice. Leg room is restricted because of a box at your left side, the seat is hard especially after a couple of hours and this was a 7h40m flight. It's quite tight 
width wise too, and I'm slim and 5ft 9in so not large by any standard. The meal was the usual chicken or pasta, and I had 1 G&T. Breakfast about 1 hour before landing was some sort of chees/egg bap with coffee. The crew did not clear away the rubbish after the breakfast meal and it was impossible to get out of your seat with all the trays still down. The usual very dry air feeling for me as well and these planes are supposed to have better oxygen levels, but I found this flight one of the worst. The delays meant that we mised our connecting flight to Glasgow at 12.25. We were re-booked for 21.00, but luckily got a stand by flight at 16.10. I found signage and navigation at Heathrow T5 pretty poor when you're looking for connecting flight information and I don't understand why you need to go through security again when you have never left airside of operations.

"A week before our flight the times were changed from a 10 am flight to 7.10am flight not ideal for a 3 year old. No real problem booked bloc hotel night before which i realise is now much better than the business class I booked for my child's first flight. The flight didn’t take off to 8:45 with us sitting in crappy, cramped airplane which felt worse than Ryan air & easy jet put together. If I was told and shown the layout of the plane before I would have never booked business and probably flown with someone else. 

Ba lounge expecting a quick breakfast etc there was no where to sit. It now feels the norm and everyone is in the lounge with easily 300 people crowed around danish pastries. Very disappointed so we went straight to the terminal. Waist of money again duped. 

The plane omg when I saw it I just thought it hadn’t been upgraded in 25 years and would surely not even make it off the runway but luckily that did happen 1 of 2 positives. The second positive point was Andy the steward who went over and above to try a pull magic out of thin air but good humour and perfect service will only get you so far. Especially when you decide to go to the toilet which in all other planes has been fine before to my knowledge. I’m tall 6,4 ft not that tall but I couldn’t even get in so I just turned round and sat back down really great for business class. I usually have to book business or extra leg room but I couldn’t even fit my legs in the chair so out they went into the isle where every 5 secs the trolley came or someone came so I had to stand each time counted this 76 times during 2 hour flight, maners maketh etc but still I can’t help my height and my long legs but when you book extra leg room/business you expect to be able to sit for the flight.

All in all the flight was terrible 0, plane terrible 0, staff 5, cost for what you got 0.

"I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the service provided by British Airways. I have a reservation for flight BA0292 from Dulles Washington Airport to London on October 2, 2023. Despite opting for an upgrade to World Traveler Plus and paying £243 for the privilege, I encountered difficulties during the online check-in process. The system automatically assigned me a middle seat, contrary to my preference for a window seat following the upgrade.

Despite multiple attempts to seek assistance through customer service, which appears to be outsourced to India, I have been met with unhelpful responses. The representatives assert that all seats are occupied and that there is an allegedly reserved window seat that cannot be reassigned. I have requested to speak with a manager on four occasions, but each time I have been informed that managers are either unavailable or unable to assist.

I am deeply disappointed by the lack of customer support and the handling of my upgraded seating arrangement.

"My wife and I have just returned from a 3 week trip to Canada & the USA. This was a once in a lifetime trip to celebrate my 60th birthday and our 35th wedding anniversary. I have not flown with British Airlines for many years but as this was a special occasion we decided to upgrade to premium economy. One of the main reasons for this was the configuration of the cabin which was 2-4-2 meaning if we pre-booked our seats we could select 2 together without having to sit next to anyone else. The cost to pre-book the seats was expensive, £75.00 per seat per person per journey (£300.00 in all). Going out we had no issues. I say that however the flight was delayed for nearly 2 hours. Why, well the plane was electric and no one had remembered to plug it into a charger so nothing worked. No I am not joking and it would have been laughable had they not decided to board us onto the plane whilst it charged up. All the while there was no air conditioning and it was like an oven on board. That said, the flight was good and we got great service from the cabin crew.
A couple of days before our return flight we received an email from BA saying that there had been an alteration to our flight but the email claimed nothing had changed other than the flight number. As a consequence we didn’t pay much attention to it. When we boarded the aircraft the seats we had paid for were not available to us and we ended up sitting in a row of 4. We complained but the staff couldn’t do anything about it because it was a full flight. On landing at Heathrow again a series of events that were just farcical. We delayed from leaving the aircraft for what seemed an eternity as the pilot was moved from one stand to another by the BA ground crew and then it felt like there was just one person in baggage handling as luggage was just coming off in one and two’s. All in all not a great experience and would think twice about flying BA again.",3.0,Washington DC,London,International,September 2023,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0

"I was returning from a short trip to New York, and had been flying overnight. This was the second/last leg of my journey. The flight was delayed by half an hour, but the only reason given while we were waiting was that there had been a delay to a previous flight. They asked for passengers to volunteer to check in their bags as they had a 'full to capacity' flight, so couldn't fit all hand baggage in the cabin (!). Apparently our incentive to do this was that it was 'free'. This is not an incentive. If you want people to voluntarily delay their own journeys you have to compensate them sufficiently, i.e. financially. Due to no-one volunteering to be delayed by checking in their cabin bags, an unpleasant staff member began to make her way through the passengers, and selecting us to force us to check in our cabin bags! I was told that she was doing this for all passengers in groups 4 and above (i.e. economy!). The reason I travel with just cabin bags is to avoid having to delay my journey unnecessarily by having to collect baggage from the carousel. Thank goodness this was my last leg and not the first leg of my outward journey, where I might have missed my connection due to the delay. I had to remove medication from my large cabin bag (extra inconvenience for me), and when I boarded, I discovered that the passengers in the seats next to me had been permitted to take their large cabin bags aboard! In fact, many passengers in groups 4 and above had not been forced to check in their large cabin bags. So, not only had I been delayed and inconvenienced - I'd been lied to. Unless I have to I won't be using BA again. It seems to be their policy to treat economy passengers very unpleasantly, delaying, inconveniencing, and lying to them. As if BA are doing us a favour! No, BA. We are paying your wages. Please at least treat us with just a teeny tiny subatomic amount of respect. In fact, my suggestion is to offer passengers inconvenienced in this way a voucher for a future BA flight. This way, passengers would be compensated for their inconvenience, but BA would be more likely to see them again.

"'m writing this review with great disappointment and frustration after our recent experience with British Airways. Despite reaching out to them repeatedly over the past month, we've received nothing but negligence and dissatisfaction in response to our flight disruptions.

Our group of 12 travellers embarked on a journey on 21st August with high hopes, but those hopes were quickly dashed by British Airways' poor handling of our trip.

Our outbound flight from Gatwick to Orlando was canceled suddenly, forcing us into an exhausting journey from Gatwick to Heathrow, followed by a 24-hour layover and a series of connecting flights via Manchester. This upheaval not only robbed us of valuable holiday time but also ruined our pre-booked Disney events for the kids. To make matters worse, our pushchair was lost during this leg of the journey, and we had to incur additional expenses to rent a stroller.

Our return flight from Orlando to Gatwick was no better. It was unexpectedly cancelled, and we were redirected through Dallas and then to Heathrow, despite our initial departure from Gatwick. This resulted in another 24-hour delay, further disrupting our travel plans. To add insult to injury, the behaviour of British Airways staff was far from helpful; they were rude and uncooperative when we sought assistance with transportation from Heathrow to Gatwick.

These issues were compounded by a lack of clear communication, inadequate alternative arrangements, and an overall dismissive attitude from your staff. At Gatwick Airport, we were advised to pay for hotels at Heathrow and taxi fares, with the promise of reimbursement within 7 days. It has now been over a month, and there has been no communication or reimbursement in sight. The financial burden this has placed on us is unacceptable, and we are left in the dark about when or if we will be reimbursed.

While we understand that unforeseen circumstances can lead to flight changes, we expected a higher level of care and professionalism from British Airways. The way these situations were handled and the subsequent customer service have severely damaged our perception of your airline.

We implore British Airways to take this complaint seriously and address the issues we've highlighted. What was supposed to be a joyful celebration turned into a frustrating ordeal that has left us deeply disheartened. We hope that British Airways will take the necessary steps to rectify this situation, restore our confidence in their services, and ensure that other travellers do not endure such a disappointing experience.",1.0,London,Orlando,International,August 2023,1.0,1.0,N/A,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

We were due to depart at 15.10 and land at 16.40 a scheduled flight time of one hour and thirty minutes.

Boarding commenced at 14.30 and was completed  at 15.05, the doors closed shortly afterwards and the aircraft pushed back 15.20, we were airborne sixteen minutes later, twenty-six minutes later scheduled.

We were informed that the delay in our departure was due to problems with Air Traffic Control. Also the expected flight time would be fifty-five minutes, it was actually just over an hour.

We were travelling as Club Europe passengers and we were seated in Row 2. We had three seats between two of us, the centre seat was filled in so that we  could use it as a table. All very comfortable and plenty of legroom.

Around thirty minutes into the flight we were offered afternoon tea, which consisted of 
salmon with cream cheese and a scone with cream & jam. We declined the afternoon tea, preferring to have a beer instead.

The distance from Lounge to Gate was extensive - at least 20 mins fast walking.

"We started our day with BA in Prague. The flight actually left on time! I came to find out that’s very unusual.

We purchased business class seats. As you can see from the picture they hardly were business class. All they did was block off the middle seat in the first few rows and called it business class.
Horrible flight.

In addition I had a really rude rude check in clerk basically yell at me when I excused myself and asked if she could give a little bit of priority to the many business class passengers who weren’t being served.

Then we got to Heathrow and the real fun began.

We had a 4 hour delay.

They gave us about 5 different excuses for the delay. 

I had a few employees walk away while I was asking them questions. They were very rude. At one point there were no employees left.

And from the announcements it seems virtually every BA flight was delayed. And there were no weather issues.

There was no place to comfortably store items in business class. I’ve never experienced that before. Not even a cup holder for my bottle of water.

The seat controls didn’t work well. You had to keep pushing the buttons to get them to do anything.

The power outlet didn’t work.

There was no internet the entire flight.

The overhead luggage bin was too heavy. I almost got a hernia having to close it.

This is a horrible airline. I’ll never fly with them again.

"Our flight to Dubai was quite good, boarded on time, we had window seats, and in premium, the seats are 2/3/2.

The cabin crew came round within 15 mins of boarding with a drink, of either sparkling wine or juice. Very nice touch.

Then they came with menus for the flight, not bad choices, but I do have to say, they ran out of the beef before getting to us! so I had pasta, and hubby was just going to manage with the food on the tray, however after a few mins, the crew came back with a beef meal for hubby, and he did enjoy it.
The pasta was quite nice, it was nice to be able to eat on proper plates and with good cutlery.
Crew also served drinks with the meal, 

The inflight entertainment was good, plenty of choice for tv programmes and movies.

This was a 7.5 hour flight, so we were ok and comfortable. plenty of leg room, for hubby, hes 6ft 3 and needs space.
The bathrooms were fine, standard for any 7 hr flight.
No separation from premium and economy, ( emirates are so much better with this).

The captain did keep us informed which was nice.

The crew came around again about an hour or so before landing, and gave us a nice snack and drink. 

overall, the flight was nice, comfy and we had food and drink the inflight entertainment was fine, the crew was nice. no issues

"I have travelled a lot, with many different airlines, and this is the first time I had a truly negative experience. The experience was bad enough that I swore never to fly with British Airways again. I had a connection in London, at the Heathrow airport. I don't know if this was the airline's fault or the airport's, but for the first time in my life, I wasn't given a gate number until 30 minutes before take off. Not boarding time, I'm talking about take off time displayed on the airport monitors.  At a large, busy airport where it takes 10-20 minutes to get to your gate. I found the help desk for British Airways, but there was a long line that was not moving, plus I couldn't stay in line and keep my eyes on the monitor with the gate information the same time, so I couldn't get any information. The gate number is finally announced, no one gives us any information on the delay or apologizes at the gate, you couldn't even hear the boarding instructions (boarding group numbers), they weren't using a PA system, or at least shout. 15 minutes after boarding finally we were informed by the pilot about everything, about additional delays as well, but at this point I couldn't inform people waiting for me at my destination about the additional delay, since there was no wifi on the plane, even though we hadn't left the gate. You couldn't connect to the airport's wifi anymore. Finally we arrived at our destination with an hour and 15 minutes delay, and I received my bags. 3 brand new, sturdy Samsonite suitcases all banged up, scratched up, a little piece chipped off of one of my luggages' handles also. All of them. They even made me check-in my carry on (cabin luggage), which I used only once before, that one is banged up too. 4 out of 4 suitcases. Thank God I removed my laptop from my carry-on, before allowing it to be checked in. They told us on the plane that one of the reasons for the delay was that they had to manually load the suitcases. I have flown with the exact same kind of luggage before, exact same, just different colors, let me tell you they did not arrive in this condition. Now it's not enough that I am 1 and a half hours late, I have to wait in line at the baggage claim, furious at this point, the line is not really moving, there are 3 groups of people in front of me (from the same flight), all of them with lost luggage issues. How dare they treat their customers' personal property like this!? Also, it was the first time in my life that I didn't get a meal on the small plane. When I book an overseas trip, I always get a meal on the small plane too, because you've been coming from far away, with the layover and everything, it's been included in the ticket with every other airline so far. But that was actually the least of my problems. Cabin crew was professional, they were fine, just not the employees at the gate at Heathrow or whoever was handling the luggage.

"Having booked a BA flight which was cancelled by the airline about 3 hours before take off without any declared reason I was directed to Travel Up (an agency I had booked through via Opodo) for a refund. I should point out that BA were at least punctual in alerting me to the cancellation, unlike the agent who told me after we should have checked in. As there were no other flights that day I booked a train for a further £100. I was told that the airline decides how much the refund should be (I had paid upwards of £100 for two tickets) and that I should wait for 6 weeks to be refunded by the agent. After 6 weeks I called Travel Up and was eventually offered EITHER a voucher for about £70 to use with Travel Up or a £27.50 cash refund. As neither option is acceptable I have requested an explanation of precisely where the £100 I paid for the non-flights has gone. In the ensuing deathly hush I am posting both here and also on Travel Up’s reviews in the hope of stirring up a response. Or even a refund.

I knew there was more to this nonsense and i was correct as when we landed at Heathrow it took another 2 hours to get the bags off and my priority club class luggage once again come off last, this airline needs to shut and start again, is it hate speech as i hate BA and their pathetic constant lying. its a shame they bought the many routes reducing my options. i nearly forgot!  how can you be this expensive and this bad and get away with it. shocking.",1.0,London,Gibraltar,Europe,September 2023,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

The airport staff said the luggage would be delivered to us at home within 24 hours.

"Have given this review an average rating, due solely to the boarding process and the baggage handling at LHR T5.  The actual check in at SFO and the flight and cabin crew could not be faulted.

The boarding at SFO was chaotic to say the least, no organisation and announcements that could not be heard.  It was a shambles.

The actual flight was very good, we left 40 minutes late but we actually landed early.  The seat was comfortable, as was the cabin.  The stewardess that was looking after us was very friendly and all the crew were jovial and approachable.  The food and beverage offering were very good and enjoyable.  The IFE had a good selection of films and music to while away the 11 hours.  After the meal service I managed to get around five hours sleep on the comfortable bed, supplemented by the 'White Company' mattress pad, blanket and comfy pillow.

For the breakfast offering I just had the fruit and juice, which were very nice.

When we arrived, we were early, however, initially we were advised that we may have an hour wait to get our gate as the plane in there had broken down and could not leave.  It turned out, after ten minutes, they found another gate for us to disembark.

We flew through security and thought we had cracked it.  Then came the baggage issues!!  The LHR app said belt 7 but the screens said belt 8, neither belts offered up any luggage and finally after about 40 minutes, maybe more, the bags started to arrive on 8.  LHR recons its BA's fault and BA didn’t respond.  It is always the same at LHR, no matter who I fly with.  Bags are always late.  Somebody needs to sort it out as it put the UK to shame compared to other global airports.

"Ok well the first point I need to make is that this booking was on Avios points and thank God for that. If we had paid the full price of about 4k each  I would have been devastated. Let’s start with the positive, going out air crew once on board absolutely fantastic. Now the negatives, flight cancelled twice and had to rebook, seats changed on entering aircraft and different plane on return meaning change of seats 4 times. Crew coming back the opposite, couldn’t be bothered, rushing, short of patience. If BA wish to offer a 5* service on its long haul non USA flights they need to step it up. I can’t help feeling since the pandemic they have dropped the ball. If the USA is your thing price wise BA have pretty got that market stitched up but if you are going Business Long Haul elsewhere  I would recommend a good look round. In August I booked a Business Class return from London to Johannesburg for next June. BA wanted between £2800-3200 each, I finally booked with Swiss, yes it means a change at Zurich but cost £1800 each, a massive saving of between 2-2.5k. In addition to this free seat selection where if you are not a BA Silver member or above you can pay up to £100 to reserve 1 seat. If I am paying BA that kind of money, I want what’s on the menu, I don’t want to be chopped and changed around and I would really like some proper customer service and not wait over 3 months for a response to my issues.

"In late August I traveled from Athens to New York having a connection flight in London- both flights were with British airways. My first flight from Athens to London got very much delayed and as a result I missed the connection flight to NY. We were informed that we had to spend the night to London and travel the next day to our final destination. Most passengers got a voucher for accommodation, transportations and meals (both dinner and breakfast for the next day). To my astonishment, I received none. When I asked the reason they told me that the airlines did not have other vouchers for the rest of us and it was my responsibility to find somewhere to stay, get a transport and of course have something to eat for the night and the next day before the final flight. I was traveling by myself, I had no cash on me and, of course, my phone sim card did not work in Great Britain. So, I as ked help from other passengers and I made some calls. I found out that the nearest hotels to the airport were overbooked for the night except one that cost around $470 / night (US dollars). It was an outrageously expensive price but I had no other option. Of course to the expenses was added transportation by taxi (I was carrying 2 big luggage, a laptop and a backpack). No voucher for food or refreshments was given to me so I needed to save money for all the extra costs and the second luggage that I paid again the next day taking the other flight. 
No matter how much I tried to receive some help British Airways employees were completely unhelpful and seemed like they had absolutely no clue on what to do. I faced a big discrimination in terms of who they chose to give the voucher and who did not deserve it.

Very poor meal service on out Dubai London leg.
And, if course, a bag didn't turn up on our flight home. It wasn't 'lost ' - they knew exactly where it was. Just not loaded along with 21 other bags.
It wasn't loaded on the next 5 flights to out destination either. To make it worse, the BA missing luggage web page specified a specific flight the bag would be on. It wasn't. And then a further 24 hour wait before it was delivered to us.

"After many travel trips on various sized aircraft, I learned a new thing that was revealed to me and the other BA passengers that, a 'GPU' was not available to us at the time for our plane in Barbados, this meant that without the engine's started, We only had air-plane lighting, but no A/C

 Ground Power Units are battery-powered generators that supply energy to the aircraft allowing the electrical systems to be operated when the aircraft is on the ground. (apparently)

So we sat on the tarmac in 32c (warmer on the plane as the doors were closed, so their was no blow through,...)

The staff had served chilled water as we boarded, and did their best to walk up and down the cabin, in a health and safety manner looking for fainters, as the GPU unit was not available for 20mins, and then the old unit they found that was attached to the plane failed,.

Eventually, a unit was attached to the plane and struggled to generate enough Oomph, to power the planes A/C

by this time. Sweat was pouring from everybody and the Cabin crew 'Oh my days' just smiled and answered questions, and comforted the occasional overheated passengers,..Brilliant, BA Staff absolutely exemplary in their duty, while suffering the same as we were,.

Then 'Whooo Hooo' the right then left engine started up and A/C started to flow through the cabin.

Thank you BA onboard staff, for working and holding station through a very uncomfortable 'sweat wait', while continually assuring passengers and serving as best they could in a situation that could've turned mutinous resulting in us all ending up back in the Terminal insisting on our 'health rights' which would've created a nightmare onward travel fiasco.

"To begin, I'd like to mention that I'm writing this review not only as a client, but also as a customer support specialist.
In a nutshell - due to unjustified delay of the transatlantic flight my family didn't make to their connected one. They arrived to their destination almost 12 hours later, with dammaged check-in luggage (which is what they saw at the transfer airport).
We've made a complaint about the delay and broken suitaces, which was rejected by BA - they expect us to approach Lufthansa (the airline that provided two return flights instead of the one my family was late for) about the luggage, even though it was not damaged through their fault. In addition, despite requests, we have not received any proof that the first flight was delayed through a fault that was beyond BA's control. They're even digging their own grave by mentioning Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 February 2004 establishing common rules on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights, and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 295/91, especially article 5.3:
'An operating air carrier shall not be obliged to pay compensation in accordance with Article 7, if it can prove that the cancellation is caused by extraordinary circumstances which could not have been avoided even if all reasonable measures had been taken.'
It means that either they're breaking the law on purpose or they're not even reading emails with understanding.
But what we did get? In three emails we had copy-pasted paragraphs about how Heathrow Airport works (even after I asked not to do so).
Given my experience of customer service, I am even more unpleasantly surprised by the lack of professionalism of the staff. I know very well that such behaviour only discourages the client from the company.
From the client's perspective - we intend to pursue the issue, even if it ends up in court. I would sincerely advise anyone against using these airlines.",1.0,Chicago,Krakow,International,July 2023,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

"We made the mistake of using BA (again) - this will never happen again and we will now also actively discourage everyone in our networks to both avoid and discourage flying BA, as well as find every way possible to raise wider awareness and of how appalling BA have become. 

This is the 2nd time in the last few months that BA have cancelled a return flight at the last minute, without informing us and with zero customer service either ok the phone or at the airport. The flight out was also delayed by nearly an hour - with the delay only being posted a few minutes before the scheduled boarding time. It is pretty clear BA cancelled the return flight for its own economic reasons and also decided to rebook us on one of its cheaper flights late on the day despite still selling seats online on earlier flights. BA online we’re even still allowing us to buy 2 seats on an earlier flight whilst we were stood at check in where the BA check on staff were saying there were no seats and the flight was closed. We only found out our flight was cancelled as my partner has the BA App - no email or anything from BA. When we called to try to arrange seats on another flight whilst already on our way to Geneva, the unhelpful BA person (can’t describe them as customer service as BA don’t care about customers at all) just said they couldn’t do anything as we had checked in online already? Go figure. At the airport the staff at check in said they couldn’t do anything and that BA had no desk at the airport to help either. BA have one job - run their scheduled flights  (that we pay for at premium prices) and if there are unexpected (unavoidable rather than because they’ve decided at the last minute it’s more financially viable to cancel the flight) then do what is necessary to place passengers on other airlines as near to the same time as the flight they have cancelled. It’s not a complicated issue. Surely an organisation that has been on the same business for a long time could work this out?

We received more sincere apologies from the Swiss Airlines staff for the BA cancellation than anyone from BA we talked to on the phone or at the airport? When an airline stops caring about its passengers and their welfare and taking them for granted, and taking their passengers money for granted - it’s time to realise you should find an airline that gives you the service you’re paying for - BA doesn’t care about you or your family, or the life you’re trying to keep in balance around flights, BA just makes decisions that serve its own interests - your needs as a paying passenger have no place in BA’s decision making - you are just a commodity to be manipulated to BA’s best (financial) interests, whatever the impact.

"This airline is a joke. Weeklong business trip, BA flights all the way from Portland to London to Barcelona. First the flight was delayed two hours with no explanation, the estimated departure just kept moving further and further out. Then two unannounced gate changes sending passengers literally running in a panic to not miss their connections. One of the gate changes was to the 'overflow' gates in Heathrow requiring a bus ride from the main gates in Terminal 5. Huge lines formed, staff did nothing to create a separate lane for people about to miss connection. One bus running taking 20 people at a time and returning every 10 minutes, with 100+ people in line for the one bus.

Arrived in Barcelona two hours late (and resultingly missed the airport shuttle to my hotel which had stopped running at 20:00) to find BA had lost my luggage. Filed a claim, heard nothing, finally received my bag half destroyed four days later. Filed a claim for cost of acquiring toiletries and a change of clothes, still have heard nothing.

Return flight from Barcelona was delayed, then sat at the gate to again have the one bus ferrying people back to the main tunnel proceed to take 1.5 hours to deplane, once again with no priority given to connections. Same flight to Portland was already full (overbooked) for the next day, so rerouted to Amsterdam to pick up a Delta flight the next day. Check in this morning to find out BA had booked a lower class of service with Delta than what I had paid for and BA customer service says there's nothing that can be done, including reimbursement for the cost difference.

If it had been one delay or one CS issue or something, it would have been fine... this stuff happens in international travel. But this entire trip, every single segment, every single interaction with BA staff, software or equipment was an absolute disaster.

I'm opening a case with our corporate travel agency as soon as I get home to suggest they include a warning beside any British Airways flight option and confirmation.

"We booked premium economy direct for our honeymoon to Europe.  6 hours before departure they canceled our flights, put us on two other terrible flights in economy and could not even confirm our seats.

The BA staff was kind but limited in what he could do.  I said taking a 9 hour flight in Premium and changing it to a 16 hour indirect flight in Economy was unacceptable. He eventually moved us to a different day, so we lost out on a day of our honeymoon where we were meeting with friends and had bought concert tickets for that now we will miss. 

We were told that once we checked in we could select our seats but this is NOT TRUE.  This is perhaps the worst part.  Though our tickets say Premium, we can't preselect seats because BA placed an order on another airline.  The flight is nearly sold out and the only seats available are three middle seats, next to other people. So, now there is a chance I may not even be able to sit next to my husband on our honeymoon. 

I hope that Virgin who has the new flight can rectify this cluster that British Airways has created.   I don't mean to be petty.

"Booked the flight with BA. Flight out was OK but we were at the back of the plane and were served by the on board serve less than an hour before the flight landed. 

The return flight was on time but the check in at Palma was a shambles . Two euroclub check ins primarily focusing on Euroclub passengers and no check in for the rest of us until just under two hours before departure which left everyone standing in a queue waiting and watching  Euroclub menbers being exclusively checked in. 

Then when we got on borad were told the flight was full and all normal cabin bags and anything rlse had to be put under the seat becuase the overhead lockers were full of bags which really should be in the hold becuase they're suitcases .

The plane was a cattle crate. The leg room was ridiculously minimal  compounded by the extra coats, duty free  purchases and normal sized cabin bags being rammed under seats.

 We arrived at Heathrow on time but unfortunately did not arrive at terminal 5 the home of British airways but instead we were eventually parked off the runway and had to get a bus to the terminal which took  a further 5 minutes, following a 15 minute wait to eventually disembark the plane because of the complication of waiting for the buses to arrive and also people unloading the aircraft of the their suitcases from the overhead lockers which should have been in the hold.

Cabin staff in our bit were surly.  More interested in private conversations. 

Then we were waiting a further 15 minutes for our bags to arrive.  Previously last year we had a long haul flight booked several months  in advance  which was cancelled which ruined the rest of our holiday.

"Being AMEX customers, we collect Avios but it is becoming increasingly difficult to both use Avios and companion vouchers.

During the last twelve months, we have had three flights rescheduled and one cancelled which is not what you would expect from BA. 

What frustrates me though is that we as customers are expected to foot the bill which is morally wrong. Our December outbound flight which we booked many many months in advance was just cancelled and there are a few behaviours to highlight that you will not expect from airlines like BA:
- no explanation was provided as to why the flight was cancelled.
- even though the flight was cancelled, BA did not deem it necessary to refund us automatically and contacting any airline is not easy if you work full-time.
- even though they could not operate the flight, we as customers are expected to pay cancellation charges for the flights they could not deliver!? In more detail, because we are travelling to one and returning to UK from another airport, even though BA cancelled our outbound flight, they penalized us with cancellation and services fees for the cancellation of our return flight which we cannot use unless we choose to spend £2361.23 more. This was described as 'normal redemption cancellation rules'.

I do love the cabin crew but I feel the rest of the business is letting them down but hey, maybe the executive club is a thing of the past considering they are unable to operate adequately anymore.

However, when boarding was announced, we queued to board and then the staff at Prague airport B2 decided to issue us with a seat change which was in row 25.  Wasn't very happy regarding this as the staff could have forewarned us prior to boarding.
When boarding the plane Craig one of the cabin crew asked if I was ok. My answer was NO, and he asked what the problem was. Explained about the seat change so he said he could put us in row 16, which was better than 25.
Anyway, we settled in our seat and were ready for take off when another female cabin crew member advised that she would seat us in row 4.
We finished up being treated extremely well with a cooked meal and liquid refreshments.
We can't thank these two cabin crew members enough as they both went out of their way to make our flight back comfortable. They were both so helpful, so BA you need to look after these crew members as they are the two best people we have ever dealt with in all the flights we have ever taken, and they are both fully customer focused, which seems to be lacking with most other staff.

"I can't believe how bad BA has become, they have lost our bags on the way back from Portland (missing >2 weeks) and there is zero help. The call centres are all international, the website never works and, ironically, they are getting too many calls that you can't even get through. 

They have lost our bag with all our wedding gifts and dress in it. We cannot believe that this has happened and it has caused devastation in our family. These items are irreplaceable and bits we couldn't take onboard with us. The customer service centre is not based in the UK and you can never speak to a UK-based customer agent.

Adding to the above, the cost of flights, level of service and general nature of BA nowadays is poor. We usually fly Delta and thought we'd give BA a chance, never again!

"This is advice for anyone flying British air. If you have a very short connection in anyway and you want to stay with your luggage understand that unless there’s at least a three hour waiting period between the time you catch your new flight (our original flight was cancelled, and we were put on a new flight 3 hours later). and you have checked luggage, there is better than 50-50 chance you will not get your luggage.  (according to many other stories I’ve heard from people over the past 3 days I’ve met in the hotel we stayed in as well as those we met in the line waiting at the airport to reclaim our luggage)  

I was worried about our luggage, but we were assured that if the luggage didn’t follow, it would be transported to our hotel within 24hours once it was received on the next flight out. (This was stated to us three times) 
Transportation does not happen at least with the Amsterdam Airport this fast. We waited 3 days after being told on the phone every morning at 9am (baggage claim is only open 9 to 5 ) by British air employees 

my recommendation is if your luggage doesn’t follow you, go to the airport to collect and don’t listen to anybody or believe anybody that tells you they will deliver your luggage
 it was 4 days of waiting for our luggage to arrive before I smartened up and went to the airport. Once there I learned that there are over six areas inside the airport were luggage is just stored and each of these areas have over 200 bags easily.

"The seats are narrow and uncomfortable. On my return flight I arrived and there was no seat. Apparently the cover kept coming.ing away the attendant bought the cushion for my seat. It was a 23hrs flight, the cabin was extremely hot despite telling the flight attenandant
 Nobody in our row had ear phones and they never came back with them. Despite this, we revieved them the second leg and the entertainment was old and uninteresting. The food was ok first leg but the second leg was inedible apart from the bread roll. The charging ports to all legs did not work. Overall appalling. The flight attendants appeared to be running around but not responding when asked for things and unapproachable. The flight was expensive, for me it was a COVID credit note which I had to add the same amount again. The website does not work, could not access it AT ALL for my return flight.

I have been a silver card holder for 10 years and spent so much money with BA. I made a booking and within 5 mins I realised i made a mistake and had to cancel the ticket which is my legal right within 24 hours full refund. This is where the problem starts as BA Silver line did not answer the phone and the line would cut off saying please call back. I did this for 5 days and emailed BA also. Every time I got the reply saying we are busy and will reply in 7 days. Eventually i called and someone answered and said as I did not call within 7 days all I can have back is £30 refund instead of £600 I am due. This is a con. They offer a refund yet will not answer the phone. I am loyal silver customer who has spent so much money with them and this is how they treat me. It's a disgrace and I never going to fly BA again.

"TL:DR; the only thing they didn't screw up was crashing the plane; we've given up trying to get reimbursed because customer service keeps sending us in circles and hanging up on us

- On our way to Portugal and back, all four of our flights were delayed anywhere between 30 minutes and 2 hours
- On the way there, they lost all five of our bags. I'd attached my email address and colored ribbons to each one so that they'd be easy to keep track of, but that apparently didn't do anything for them. We got them back in ones and twos, between day 3 and day 5 of our 7-day trip.
- On the way back, they lost our baby's carseat again. We were exhausted and sick and couldn't get home until a family member drove to a store to buy us a new carseat.
- We tried to call customer service on about 5 different days. No matter who we talked to, we were always in the wrong department. Most of the time, they ‘accidentally’ hung up on us and we could never get back in touch with whoever we’d talked to.
- I also tried contacting Customer Service by email. They told us that our carseat had probably been stolen from the airport and so they weren’t responsible for it. When I pointed out that they were talking about the wrong flight, they copy-and-pasted their original message and changed the name of the city (with the dates still incorrect) and sent that to me. I asked to talk to a manager and just got the same response as before copy and pasted.

Basically, we’re tired of getting incensed by trying to deal with them, and accepting that they’re just keeping our money. It was an expensive carseat but at this point just forgetting about it and not being angry is probably worth more to us. I’ll post this review in a few places in hopes that others can avoid nightmares like this by flying with someone else, and we’ll be strongly recommending to anyone who’s considering British that they pick any other option.",1.0,Portland,Lisbon,International,June 2023,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,2.0
"My wife is in a wheelchair and needs an aisle chair to get to her seat.  On most airlines, that is done before all other passengers board.  Not on this flight.  We got to the aisle chair to her seat and we couldn't figure out how to get the armrest up to get her into the seat.  The flight attendants were all standing around chatting with each other.  When I had the audacity to ask one for help, her response was how would she know, she flies on a number of aircraft.  My wife has Alzheimer's and she thought she had done something wrong and began to cry.  One of the passengers even came to her rescue and told the attendant that she was there to help not cause passengers to cry.  Totally unprofessional and rude.  But it doesn't end  there.
As usual, on all other airlines we have flown, we wheel my wife to the door and leave the wheelchair to be loaded.  The flight attendant even came back to our seats and handed me a receipt and said it would be waiting for us at the door in Pittsburgh.  When we arrived, and exited the plane, no wheelchair.  All flight attendants leave and we are confronted with no chair.  It's about 9 P.M. on Labor Day and their response was that we would have to rent one until they could find it.  Unbelievable.  They did eventually find an old beat up wheelchair and gave it to us to use after making our ride wait over and hour.  Totally inexcusable.

"My wife and I were due to fly to Alicante to see my Dad in March. We both got covid a few days before we were to fly and we could not travel. I contacted Customer Service and they advised me to get a doctors letter etc and file it with them to preserve the value of the tickets. 

I did so, and after a struggle they finally accepted my documentation. They advised me to contact bookings when I needed to travel with a clear inference that my tickets would be honoured.

Upon doing so, I was disappointed to be advised that because my ticket was no longer on the system, nothing could be done and I would have to use my travel insurance. I was very unhappy about this as you might imagine.

After a lot of discussion, a wonderful person named Lauren (S2) took over and spoke with her supervisors to sort this out.

"My girlfriend and I had the bad idea of travelling with BA this year. We were among those unfortunate who got to Heathrow when the control tower misworked. Eventhough we are aware it did not depend on BA, we were not offered any help at all. Actually, different check in booths told us very different things, increasing the total caos of the airport. At the end was clear they were not able to help in any way. They didn t know anything about our luggages, nor about rescheduling the cancelled flights. All they recommended was to visit BA website for updates and rescheduling. Well..the website did not work until past midnight, and all it said then was ' your flight has being cancelled, purchase a new one' No mention of a partial refund, help with hotels, news about luggages.
The day after we went to the airport early to be told they still knew nothing about luggages, and also that there was no free alternative flights, there was no paid flights also for the next 3 days. We opted for another company.
On our way back we got stuck again in Heathrow. This time there was no problems with the airport. We were told the aircraft cabin could not be cooled off. They kept us at the gate for 3 hourse. We could not rebook a new complementary flight cause the actual flight was nor cancelled or marked delated. At the end we decided to take a new flight but we could not as we technically were still on this flight.
Against the manager advise, according which we shall have waited longer,we asked the check in to be 'unboarded' and we received a new flight for the day after. BA refused to pay for accommodation, arguing that they would have paid it in chicage where we lost our connection, but not in London...like it was our fault to be stuck in that craphole airport.
We are now at the hotel..at 10pm we have the curiosity of checking with what happened with the original delated flight..it was just cancelled. As BA cancelled 7 flights at the same time, all the rest of paying customers who waited at the gate did not find a hotel, and did not find an alternative fligh.

We caught the earlier flight and were assured our baggage would be re-booked.  Our bags were lost for three days (we also had medicines missing) so we had to buy new clothes, etc.

"it was my wife's birthday this week and my upcoming 60th. As such I decided to splash out and for the 1st time in my 60 years travel business class rather than economy. It cost around double the normal fair and the main advantage to me was the wider seats and the greater leg room. 

What actually happened?  got to heathrow, went through fast track which seemed just as long as normal, went to lounge, nice food though so busy we struggled to find anywhere to sit at all.

Excitedly got on the plane stunned to find that the business class seats were EXACTLY the same as the rest of the plane, they had just put a tray across the middle seat, so no extra width and no leg room, just as uncomfortable as the seats that cost half as much. I was furious, then calmed down and was just deeply dissapointed that BA had ruined my special 60th trip that i was so excited about.

We were in the 6th row out of 7. they were serving Salmon or lamb or some disgusting aubergene vegetarian thing. I don't think anyone wanted the vegetarian so when they got to row 6 (and 7) there was no salmon and no lamb it was aubergene or nothing. I and i think everyone else took nothing. So my business class meal was a bag of mixed nuts (they did give me 2 bags of nuts).

Oh well at least we arrived very early at heathrow and our luggage was marked as VIP priority. whilst we were entitled to 2 hold luggage each my wife's 1 bag was less than 15Kg and my 1 bag was less than 20Kg so we did not use our extra allowance. Guess whose bags came off last after ALL the non VIP bags?  yep ours.

So for more than double the cost i got basically nothing?

Will I fly BA again?  yes if i cannot find another airline going where i am going but they are now my last choice.

"I am so disappointed by BA, once such a great airline but now little customer care and a faceless. money-taking machine that has no regard for their passengers.
I spoke to a BA representative in mid-August to let them know my son would no longer be able to take the outward-bound leg of his journey to France.  The representative mentioned nothing about BA's 'no show' policy on the phone to me, so when it came to booking my son back on his return flight it came as a complete shock that we couldn't book him in.  I spent a further 2 hrs on the phone with BA trying to get some help, nothing.
I ended up booking another ticket for my son through Opodo but because we had so little notice of the situation and although the booking said it was successful when we got to Nice, Lufthansa said there was no booking for my son because we'd done it through a 3rd party under 24 hrs before a flight.  I went back to the BA desk in desperation, as there were no other flights out of Nice that day on any airline.  I could see that the flight my son was meant to be on with his Dad and brother still had availability but it was now charging for a one-way ticket €934.  The lady at the BA desk said she would help me if I waited until everybody had booked in, she gave me a BA number in France but I told her it wasn't working.  I waited over an hour.  When I returned the lady was completely dismissive saying it wasn't her fault that the phone number didn't work.  I said my son had hand-luggage and could get on the plane, if she would let him.  She said no and that the flight was full.  My husband and other son got on the flight and surprise surprise - there was my other son's empty seat between them.
We ended up having to spend another £407 on a train ticket that got my son to London the following morning.
I wrote to BA a week ago and have heard nothing back.  I think it's an absolute disgrace that these companies get away with causing people excessive costs, undue stress and take zero accountability.

"I have almost always flown regular coach and was truly disappointed with British Airways Business Class.
 British airlines partner with American Airlines and AA was great on the way to London as Business Class.  Once we landed in London, we went to our next leg on British Airway which was NOT what I call business class which we had paid for. BA calls business class “Club Europe” and the seats are worst than seats in regular coach and were 'coach' size seats.  We were in a row of 3 seats that were so thin, uncomfortable and worn out.  The 3 seats are assigned to two people and the middle seat is left empty and this is what they call  Club Europe (their substitute for business class).  Club Europe seats do not lay down flat  if flight is 5 hours or less.  I would think it should  be a comfortable business seats which it was not at all.    I needed to walk around from those uncomfortable Club Europe seats so I went to back of plane in coach class and spoke to a couple in coach.  I really felt for the people in coach as their seats were much thinner than our seats.    BA only gave them crackers to eat for a 5 1/2 flight and 1  1/2 hours on the tarmac waiting to take off.  That was 7 hours and only crackers. 
  Then we flew British Business Class from London back to US.   This was not Club Europe as flight was over 5 hours and these  were lay down seats, but were narrow and uncomfortable.   During the long flight when everyone puts their seat in a lay down position depending on where you are sitting it can be a problem.  In order for me to go to the bathroom when seats were down, I had to crawl over another person to reach the aisle (not my husband, but a person we were not traveling with).   That was ridiculous.     If I have a choice, I will never fly BA Airlines.

"While boarding was delayed a bit and the British Airways Club Europe like pretty much all European airlines business class and is just an economy seat in a 3x3 configuration on the A320 family of aircraft with the middle seat blocked it was a comfortable if short flight from London Heathrow to Paris.

It is amazing what the crew can do service wise on such a short flight serving drinks, a meal and coffee and the meal was really nice.

While not reflecting on British Airways the views on this flight of the UK and France were lovely.

While the seats are ok on a short flight I doubt I would be happy with these seats as a business class product on some of the longer 4 or 5 hour flights to Gran Canaria or Cairo.

"The flight itself was ok, coming into land was another story. The plane started losing altitude wat to far from the airport. When we where where close I could  clearly see the airport out of the port window, and I though then we are to low. Then the plane turned to port, a 90 degree turn and the ground seemed to come towards us at an alarming rate. There where  many audible gasps from passengers on the port side. Then of course came the double whammy of repeating another 90 degree turn to line up with the runway, of course even lower and even more audible gasps, followed by two people being sick. It was frightening to be in the window seat.
Later I checked flightradar to see the flight path and it is painfully clear these planes are coming in to low and to close to the airport to make decent turns.

"My recent experience with British Airways has been an absolute disaster from start to finish, and I'm compelled to share it with you all as a cautionary tale.

First off, my flight from New York to Malaga was cancelled, a detail I only discovered upon arrival at the airport. No email, no text, no call. After 2 hours of heated discussion with BA's customer service at the terminal, I was finally moved to a different flight. 

But the ordeal was far from over. When I landed in Malaga, my baggage was nowhere to be found. This was especially stressful because I was traveling for my son's wedding. It took them a gut-wrenching 30+ hours to locate and deliver my bags. When I finally received them, I discovered my brand new iPad, its case, and a watch intended as a gift for my nephew had all been stolen.

The nightmare didn't stop there. Attempting to resolve this calamity with British Airways' customer service was like wading through quicksand. Their attitude? Rude and unapologetic. When they finally did process my claim, they essentially told me, 'You should have known better,' offering zero credit or reimbursement for my stolen items.

This has been an agonizing experience and British Airways needs to seriously reevaluate their customer service protocol. The company should own up to their mistakes rather than placing the blame on innocent passengers who have already suffered enough.

"Until now, I've never felt the need to vent my grievances on social media about a company, but British Airways has pushed me to make an exception. My husband and I are beyond annoyed with our recent experience with British Airways, and it's high time we shared our story.

On August 19th, we flew from Nairobi, Kenya to Toronto, Canada on BA064, with a connecting flight at London Heathrow. During the flight from Nairobi to London, my husband lost his camera bag, which contained thousands of dollars' worth of photographic equipment. But the real blow was the loss of 15 memory cards, each filled with precious photos and videos from our 14-day East Africa Great Migration safari. The flight crew's explanation? Someone must have mistakenly taken the wrong backpack.

Naturally, we reported this loss to BA ground personnel and even filed a police report. To our dismay, both actions have yielded absolutely no results. Once back home, we filed a formal lost baggage claim on BA's website. We made it explicitly clear in our claim that we were not interested in financial compensation or even recovery of the cameras. Our sole request was for British Airways to contact all passengers from the flight to inquire about the whereabouts of the 15 memory cards. If someone knew anything, we asked them to return these cards anonymously through BA.

We received a polite 'Dear John' message, acknowledging receipt of our claim, but were asked to wait for up to 21 days due to a high volume of claims. Concerned about the potential loss of our memories, we emailed BA's Chief Customer Officer, reiterating our non-monetary request for assistance and the urgency of our situation. More than 10 days have passed since the incident, and we have yet to receive any action or acknowledgment beyond the initial message. By now, we have no hope of recovering the precious memory cards.

As retired seniors, we saved for years to embark on this trip of a lifetime, and we're unlikely to repeat such an adventure again. My husband is a passionate photographer who loves to capture nature and wildlife on film. During this safari, we achieved our dream of witnessing the iconic wildebeest river crossing multiple times and captured incredible footage and photos. Now, all of that is lost, and British Airways has shown us no compassion or support when we reached out for assistance.

As consumers, we don't demand perfection from service providers, but we do expect companies to address legitimate customer concerns and requests. Using the excuse of 'peak summer travel' to ignore our plea is simply unacceptable. Peak summer travel is an annual occurrence, and airlines do charge a premium during this period. It's only fair that some of that extra revenue should be allocated to meet the heightened demand for customer care. But this clearly did  not happen.

Consider this a warning: if you ever find yourself in a predicament on a British Airways flight, do not expect empathy or assistance. Our experience has left us deeply disappointed, and we felt compelled to share our story.",1.0,Nairobi,London,International,August 2023,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
"I had a lot of options for a trip to Europe for 2023, but British Airways caught my attention because of the Airplane flown from Dallas to Heathrow, the second leg of my journey. I had previously flown on an Airbus A380 before the pandemic and this flight was one of the few featuring this particular airplane type but with Lufthansa in my previous experience. I’m first gonna list the pros and cons, and then my scathing evaluation.
Pros: nice clean but older airplane, flown well in a competent manner.
Cons: Terrible cabin service in Premium Economy, and the meals didn’t match the cost of the upgrade from regular economy. Very small portions of barely edible food, and very sparing with the beverage service. I received a small bottle of Sauvignon Blanc with the meal, and no offer of coffee or tea afterwards. The morning, pre-arrival snack was a cheese bagel with shirred eggs, sort of a British version of an Egg McMuffin. Again, very little in the way of beverages. No offer of orange juice or even coffee!

OK, not that’s out of the way. My biggest complaint was the unconscionable delay leaving Dallas for Heathrow, where I needed to meet a connecting flight to Munich. Over 4 hours late departing Dallas, and the connecting flight to Munich made my arrival there very late. From arrival at the Billings, MT, USA drop off at the airport with the adequate time for screening and preboarding activities to my arrival in Munich 36 hours later, I hadn’t been given adequate food and beverage service by British airways on 2 of my 3 flight legs. I was hungry and unable to sleep on the flight due to delays caused by the airline.

Final comment: I will never fly on British Airways again after this trip is over.",2.0,Dallas,London,International,August 2023,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,1.0

"I MISSED my flight because the lady at the BA counter was not trained to use an IPAD!!!
I arrived well in time for my flight but was asked to wait for more than 2 hours while being juggled from one counter to another. 
The management on the ground is an absolute joke! I kept asking for the manager at the counter but was denied saying that the manager and the supervisors are busy with some other customers. Only to find out that my husband who was not even at an airport counter was speaking with the manager (RITA) about my situation. Somehow, a man who was not travelling was given a manager to speak to but a woman who was made to wait two hours was DENIED! Such is the state of British Airways.

I tried to speak to the manager (Rita) but just could not get through to her because of her extreme unprofessionalism and another supervisor (Isher) who at a point laughed at my state when she said that the next available flight is after 8 hours. I was constantly interrupted by the CEM - Rita who spoke in a very condescending tone and kept pushing the blame to either Dubai authorities (so unprofessional) or at me by saying that it was my fault for not coming in early and that British Airways is doing a favor by emailing Dubai for me (eventhough every other airline I have flown with have done it in a matter of minutes). I especially think that Rita and Isher were very unprofessional and even found my situation amusing which reflects very poorly on British Airways as they represent management. 

After creating all of this mess, Rita and Isher conveniently left the problem to the junior staff behind the counter to deal with my case. Rita is the worst possible representation for British Airways especially as customer service staff. She has a very condescending demeanor and speaks down to her staff and customers without taking no responsibility of the situation whatsoever. 

The complete apathy and lack of responsibility shown by management at the airport is ridiculous. 

I emailed the complaints team and after causing me so much unnecessary stress I was given 5000 avios points (which are a waste for me because I am never travelling with BA ever again).

The flight was average. The complimentary snacks, although minimal, were a nice touch. However, the legroom was abysmal - if it wasn’t for the duration being as short as it was, I most certainly would have struggled.

"If I could give BA a lower score, I would. Every one of my six flights connecting to Las Vegas and back were delayed for over a total of ten hours at least. The rush through airports to make connecting flights because of these delays were ridiculous. Not only was I delayed and rerouted through other airports, thus losing chosen seats, but BA lost my baggage on both my outbound flights and inbound. Their missing baggage platform does not update and continuously tells you that your email address is wrong if you try to change details that have been input wrong. They mislabelled both bags and while one was delivered, they would not change the details of the other missing bag so that staff were looking for the right one. I was in contact with them several times about this and they still never changed it. They also do not respond fast via their Twitter account - I waited two days for a response to an urgent question. It was not even BA that found my second missing case in Las Vegas, it was only found by me when emailing the airport customer services to see if it had arrived.
When arriving back into Manchester, I found out my baggage was again lost by them. They themselves have given me no update on lost baggage and I have only found out from WorldTracer. BA claim to have a same day delivery service for baggage when it is collected - this is also information available on WorldTracer. This is false information. I am still waiting on the missing baggage after arriving back in Manchester 4 days ago, despite it being with the courier since yesterday. I have contacted BA to try and get some more information and they have basically told me that once it is with their partner courier service, it is not their concern. They give out numbers that don’t work for you to try and contact. They also continuously tell you just to wait and see if your luggage turns up. The partner courier service does not email to tell you that they have your baggage, either. It is a giant waiting game that BA want to have no part in. Every member of staff I have spoken to regarding lost luggage on outbound and inbound flights has been entirely unhelpful, and they do not want anything to do with helping you find your cases.

"It was my first time doing a so long flight so maybe I want be so good to say a good opinion. But from my perspective it was a pretty solid flight. Let's start from the seats they were pretty comfortable and you could manage where you wanted to put the upper head pillow. The stuff was soo friendly they were passing like every hour to ask if someone wants a drink or a snack(everything free) probably my best experience with stuff. About the things that they were provide. We had a pillow and a blanket which was okl for me(I am 172cm or 5.8-5.9) but I would like it a little bigger. Also the headphones they were giving you could take them with you after. The screen had a good size and it had a variety of movies series games and podcasts to hear also you could manage from your screen the light and the air conditioner over you and some other things. The whole airplane was pretty clean. The tables were easy to manage delendes on the thing you needed it( drink or eat) and it was going forward. Both of landing and take off was pretty solid. Now about the price compared to other airlines it was cheap and I think that for the things British provides is great. The place for the feets were enough to feel comfortable even if you are tall (190cm). Food was better in taste than it seemed, but nothing so special. The only DISADVANTAGE I could find it was that the route wasn't that big and probably some a little overweight people would have a problem(not me) but that is all everything else was incredibly solid and I suggest to everyone British mainly for a long flight over5-6 hours",5.0,London,Orlando,International,June 2023,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0

"BA’s sustained incompetence during a recent trip from Mykonos to Barcelona can only be described as spectacular. Flight leaving Mykonos was delayed but connecting flight from London to Barcelona delayed as well. Landed in London 1 hour before Barcelona flight departed, within the same terminal. BA agents outside jetway gave us tickets showing we were rebooked for the same flight 24 hours later. We reminded them the flight is still here and we can easily make it. Agent ignored us and we started running to gate. 3 different gates later spanning the entire terminal 5, we get to the flight. Agent refuses to assist even though we have paper tickets for the flight…sends us to a line in customer service a few gates away. Customer service is baffled as to why agent wouldn’t help, as they confirmed we were in the system on that flight (the agent at gate told us we weren’t). Customer service walked us back to gate and confronted the agent, and we finally got our tickets reissued back to the original flight. But wait…it gets so much better. 

From rebooking us for the next day on that connecting flight from London to Barcelona that we were already at the gate for (before it even began boarding), they then cancelled the flight. We received a text saying rebooked on 8 am flight next day, but heard there was an earlier 6:15 am so we waited in line at BA lounge to inquire. Agent told us there was no room on the 6:15 am flight the next morning to Barcelona and we were on the 8 am flight, then minutes later she said  “oh, you’re actually booked on  the 6:15 am flight,” next morning BA customer service confirmed our 3 bags were being loaded on the 6:15 am flight at 5:30 am. Get to Barcelona and one bag is missing. Agent tells us the bag is flying in from London one hour later and will be delivered to the hotel. 3 days and numerous wasted discussions with BA luggage agents later - BA agents refuse to confirm whether or not they have the bag, despite Iberia (who handles BA luggage in BCN) stating the bag has been at the BCN airport for days (and nobody called to tell us).  

Day 3 of lost luggage . BA “agents” have no clue where the bags are and if you show any frustration towards the situation, they immediately hang up on you. Went to the airport early for our flight home , and it took Iberia agents 10 minutes to locate our bag and bring it to us. BA put the bag tag on the bottom of the suitcase so nobody in Barcelona was easily able to scan and track it. 

Meanwhile, BA’s lost luggage “tracking website” still reads they have no idea where the bag is and agents still provide unintelligible “updates” akin to unsolvable riddles. Incompetence to the bitter end. 

BA - lie down before you hurt yourself and leave everything to other more professional and caring airlines. Never again. What a total Embarrassment for you. 

The absolute amateur nature of BA’s operations and the sheer incompetence of their staff is mind blowing to this OneWorld Emerald frequent traveler. BA’s agents all but verbalize what they are actually thinking, which is “I would really love to help you, but I simply don’t want to.”  BA is a code share for American Airlines, where I have status. However, I will never again fly on BA based on their atrocious handling of this situation (all of which was caused by BA, not us as passengers) and their non-existent guest service.

"Booked 10-Days with British Airways Holidays which included what we thought were BA return flights to Malta from Gatwick.

What a shocking experience on both flights - dirty plane, uncleaned, rubbish on the floor on the way out and a complete shambles on the way back.

What is the point in having different boarding numbers/zones when you simply stick everyone on the same bus, make them wait on it while a plane is still being cleaned, let them off before making them wait again on the stairs and then have a free for all getting on the plane with people fighting their way passed each other to get to their seats …?

Avion Express were the agent supposed to be ‘flying the flag’ but my God what a complete 5hit show.

Not one member of the crew broke a smile on either flight, the trolley service on each flight missed half the passengers out completely when it came to drinks and the boarding process on our return was a complete joke.

"This was the flight from hell.  Before we even could move away from the gate, they said that there was a problem, and they would try to get another plane.  No planes were available, but they found a part to fix the plane which would take two hours.  Next thing we knew we were all sweating.  Then they told us that they had to shut off everything to fix the plane but they were leaving the back door open so we could get air.  The crew did feed us and give us drinks.  However, the heat was unbearable, and the flight was full of young children.  Finally, they told us that they couldn't fix the plane so we would have to stay overnight, and we had to stay on the plane until they sorted things out. After five hours, we were able to get off the plane only to be standing in a line in a hot hallway.  The British airways staff on the flight tried to make the best of a bad situation but the ground lady that we dealt with was rude. We felt like cattle being sent to slaughter not human beings treated with respect and understanding. At least the people with young children were allowed to be processed more quickly.  One child looked rather sick.  I overheard the mother saying that he needed his medicine.  I hope that it wasn't in their luggage because we couldn't get it.  My husband and I had no clothes or toiletries because we hate pulling out stuff going through security.  At 7pm, we finally got to the hotel.  The food at the hotel was the worst that I have tasted in my life. I slept in my jacket and washed my underwear.  Everywhere was closed so we couldn't buy clothes.  In the morning, we bought t-shirts, toothpaste and deodorant at the airport so we could change our clothes.   We had to search and ask around all over the place about the gate the next morning.  We walked back to arrivals to find out.  I don't understand why they wouldn't show it on the boards when later flights were on the boards. I'm researching other ways to get to Europe next year.

BA flight from Rhodos to Gatwick, booked economy class but with BA status upgrades.
BA substituted Avalon Express which we did understand at the time of booking, and as booked as part of a BA Holiday at a sensible price were not worried about as less than four hours duration.

Flight was delayed by over two hours, but our APP kept is well informed.
We got a 5 Euro food voucher close to boarding time, a nice gesture but it was limited to a single shop and many passengers were not able to spend it in time due to not enough staff at the shop.
We had priority boarding, and at the gate we were informed we had been upgraded to Business Class! A really nice touch.

That scared me so I called an agent. She implied that Business Class was overbooked and if I didn't pay for seats now we could be 'bumped.' So I reluctantly selected 2 of the 3 remaining seats on the website....and she charged me MORE than the price stated on the website. I was not happy! About 15 minutes later the argent called me and said she'd moved us up to two front row seats that were NOT even displayed on the website as available.

"We awoke on a sunny Viennese morning to a message (5.30am!) that our mid-morning flight to London had been cancelled: we had been rebooked for seven this evening. Aaargh! Goodbye connections at Heathrow, goodbye friends lined up for this afternoon and tomorrow, hello an extra charge to stay in our hotel room… But wait - we’d paid a premium to travel with a full service airline, British Airways (“We’ll take good care of you…”). Surely they would be helpful! Not at all. 
Stage one of calling ended up with “we are experiencing a high volume of calls (quelle surprise!) - please try later”
So we scrambled around for other flights: none. Ryanair: none. Flights to catch Eurostar in Brussels: none. Flights to Gatwick: none. Effectively trapped in Vienna.
Stage two of phone calls to BA went to: “Your call is important to us… We will be with you shortly”. How can it be that call centres don’t realise how amazingly annoying this is? Clearly, my call is not important enough to answer!
Twenty five minutes later, the call centre operative told us what we knew: yes the only option was this evening’s flight; yes, we might be eligible for compensation but we would have to look this up on the website; yes, the flight was cancelled for ‘operational reasons’ (what does that even mean?).
And no, no hint of any sense of understanding how disruptive this was.

"I was meant to travel with my 5 year old daughter from London Heathrow to Berlin today on an afternoon flight. Flight was first delayed by an hour. Half an hour before boarding flight was cancelled. Only notification on the information board was to contact the airline. At the first information desk after waiting for 15 minutes we were told to go to another desk. The queue at that desk was already 50m long. After getting to the front in another 30 minutes extremely unfriendly staff told us that passengers of a number of cancelled flights had to go to a certain gate. When I asked to repeat the announcement because a number of people had not understood we were shouted at. When my daughter fell and hurt her head while trying to leave the queue the staff member that stood right in front of us didn't even move to the side to let her through. We had to stand in another queue to retrieve our bags and get hotel vouchers. It took another 40 minutes to get to the front of that queue. British Airways staff was only busy shouting at people not to block the entrances to the luxury shops. There were a number of families with small children in the queue, no attempt was made by British Airways to expedite these passengers. My daughter was crying at this point because she hit her head and just wanted to go home to Berlin. In the meantime we received an email that we had been rebooked on an even later flight the next day. Once we retrieved the hotel vouchers, the shuttle bus to the hotel didn't show up. We waited for an hour before we gave up and paid a taxi. At the hotel we were informed that there would be dinner paid for by British Airways but only from 9.30-11.30pm. When I pointed out that this wasn't helpful with a 5 year old, it was shortly after 8pm, staff at the hotel just shrugged their shoulders. 
Needless to say that at no point of this experience we received any apologies. Overall staff was extremely unfriendly apart from one exception. 
I previously have had good experiences with British Airways even when things go wrong. But after this experience I can't recommend flying with them and will do my best to avoid flying with them again.",1.0,London,Berlin,Europe,August 2023,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
"If I could I would give the Bordeuax airport and BA a solid - 5. My flight with BA was delayed 2 hours to midnight to London. At the drop-bag area, a BA staff's tone was rude and unfriendly when communicating with me, and she was so unhelpful with giving information that was supposed to be her responsibility. I was given a 6 euro voucher as compensation for the 2 hours delay (Maybe she thought I should be grateful for 6 euro compensation for the 2 hours of my life) and when I got through the security line all shops were closed so I could not even use the voucher. (Yet, the staff could have said something about the closing time there but she DIDN'T). During these 2 hours I hoped to work on my computer for my work the next day but the internet was as bad as the whole situation.

I was going through a bad experience and will get home at 5am in the morning but the BA staff acted like she got more things to deal with and all shops at the Bordeaux airport were more impatient to stay longer to serve us.

In this case, the vegan meals on this flight were amazing.  They had wonderful canapes, a great salad of beans and avocado, very creatively done.  The main course was a roasted butternut squash dish that was extremely good.

To make things worse - lady in seat in front of us reclined her chair (no issues with that as it is allowed), but boy you try watching your film when now the back of her seat is about 12 inches from your face !!!!!

Sorry sir, no chicken left.

Flight was smooth and a great cabin crew.

"Our British Airways flight from ORD to LHR boarded and left so late that by the time we landed in London and got off our flight, our connecting flight was no longer listed on the board.  There were no employees to ask for help the only reason we figured out which gate we were supposed to go to is because a nice lady was able to check her phone and tell us. After we took the tram to the correct gate we had to go through security. The Heathrow security checks are self service and monitored by one employee. We attempted to scan our boarding passes but the gate would not open because our previous flight was late arriving and the machine determined we wouldn't have time to make it to our flight. The employee who was monitoring the gate was useless and instead of checking our boarding pass and seeing we needed to get through, we were met with a shoulder shrug and sent to stand off  to the side with a group of about 10 other travelers. Once we all got the employees to consider helping us, we were allowed to continue, but precious minutes were already lost.  We raced through the terminal all the way to gate 24. The employee there took our boarding pass, scanned it and said I'm sorry you've been removed from the flight. It was 8:00 am and the flight was supposed to leave at 8:10am, we could still see the plane. From there we were told to go to gate A10 and speak to the customer service people there to simply print off a new boarding pass. The lady asked us who sent us there and said this is not her job. After she spent 45 mins on hold on the phone she told us the only sure way we could get there today was to get onto a 9pm flight. That flight got delayed and we ended up waiting at the airport for 16 hours. We lost out on an entire day of vacation and when we made a claim we were told we had enough time and should have been able to make it. When I reached out again and said they have it listed on their website under claims that if your flight is delayed by more than four hours and the reason is within their control (which leaving late is) then we are entitled to compensation. They simply respond saying they cant control outside factors. we were supposed to start boarding the plane in Chicago and they were just starting to load food onto it.

"Holiday in Barbados (great holiday).

Arrived at BA check in desk, checkin was slower than slowwwwww.
3 staff members on and queue was getting longer.
Staff did not appear motivated, don’t blame them when there is only 3 staff on and Plane holds around 200+ passengers (more staff needed at check in).

After an hour + standing in the queue got to check in to be told we hadn’t paid for checked luggage.

Pulled out our receipt and clearly stated we had PAID.
The check in assistance agreed it stated paid, but in her system showed as no luggage paid for.

So not wanting to go backwards and forwards (rights/wrongs blah blah blah), explained we would pay the charge…..  $300 USD later (approx £240) for 2 bags to check in.

We have gone to our travel agent to gain a refund.

"This is a review of mine and my husband's experience with BA over the past year and a half. It was important for us to write this review because over this time, we are yet to experience some value for the money we have paid to BA and their terrible service. 

Out of the 20 flights taken, 16 of them of them have been delayed.  

When we flew business class (club world)  on our way back from Mexico, my husband's seat stopped working and he had to stay in a lay down position for the entire flight. Mid way through the flight, my son's seat stopped working too. Of course the crew were lovely and apologetic, but i cannot believe how much they charge cuatomers for these old-school seats which do not even function for the one purpose people pay for them.

We booked business class seats to Tokyo and paid to reserve seats an entire year in advance (each seat costing £90 each one way). I happened to go into my booking today to add information in preparation of my journey in a month's time, to find my seats that i paid for have changed to a mid row seat, which i will be sharing with another passenger. These are seats i paid for, reserved a year in advance and was not informed that they had given my seats to someone else (no doubt a gold member or BA Friends and Family) and just not bothered telling me. When i called BA they stated that they can make changes to seats due to 'operational reasons' and had no explanation to why that was or why i had not been informed and of course at this stage, they only had the worst seats available. All i was offered was a refund on what i paid for my seats initially and whatever terrible seat they had moved me and my husband to.

I wanted to book my seat in advance for my return from Jamaica as it is a night flight and guess what, BA's system would not give us the option to reserve seats, even though we paid for business class seats. When speaking to the customer service agent, he couldn't understand why that was as he could apparantly see the seats and reserve on his side. When trying to reserve them through him, he could not identify the model of the aircraft and had to try and explain the seat configuration, availability etc over the phone. We were asked to pay the extortionate rate of £90 one way per seat to reserve, but this time to do it blind. 

We have an American Express Platinum card which means we get a  companionship voucher each yeat if we spend a certain amount on the card and collect enough avios. After the pandemic where our flights got cancelled again and again, we ended up having 2 vouvhers which had to be used within a certain time period. BA would not extend the voucher (fine), but to make things more difficult, wouldn't allow us to use the other coucher for our children to take a family trip. They usually would do this as the vouchers allow it, but by changing the name of the voucher post covid, they made it impossible for us all to fly, meaning we had to take 2 holidays without the children rather than 1 family holiday. This was totally uncalled for, especially with the amount we had spent.and the avios we had worked so hard to collect. 

I'll stop with my experiences at this point. I understand these things may not seem like such a big deal but with the amount of effort, expendature and loyalty we have given to just have a nice experience of flying and going on holiday, BA have ruined it again and again. I am left feeling like no mayter how much we pay, or how far in advance we book, BA really couldn't care less about their customers unless they are constantly flying first class with them.  It literally is 'money speaks the loudest' with this company. I am so disgusted.

"This was my first long haul with BA and to say I was disappointed would be an understatement. Yes they got me to and fro safely to my destination, we appreciated the additional hours on the flight going out were unavoidable due to unforeseen circumstances.  There seemed to be less space than I remembered experiencing with other carriers. I was cold overnight and asked for an additional blanket, after a second request I was told there were no spares on the plane. However, my sister-in-law in premium economy said there were spare seats with blankets present. One of these had not been offered.  The food and description given of this when asked for choice was poor. The staff made you feel you were ‘cattle class’ and yet any flight is not inexpensive and you should not have to upgrade to be made to feel worthy.  Our seating had been changed on the way out  but this was dealt with to our satisfaction.  On the way back we were only offered a cold drink with our meal which was not good quality. During the night a small plastic cup of water was offered to guests awake. The only offer of a hot drink was for breakfast which was 2 hours before landing, 10 hours in to the flight.  I didn’t have breakfast but had difficulty recognising what the passenger next to me had. 
Some of my family that had travelled back earlier in the week and encountered a delay. Their luggage had not been kept secure. On returning to home and opening their cases their duty free had been taken from these. They have raised this with BA but are awaiting a response as they are busy.  Such approach reflects the total lack of customer care we experienced throughout.  I expected better of what I considered a flagship company for Britain.

"We booked 3 flights for Turkey July 2023, in December 2022
 
Unfortunately, my granddaughter started having seizures, so we phoned BA, who informed us, that she was a flight risk and couldn’t travel and I would need to send copies of a doctors letter and hospital admission which I duly did.  When I eventually got hold of someone, BA stated my granddaughters condition wasn’t terminal and therefore I was not entitled to anything, other than taxes which was just under £30, though the flight was £300 plus.  
Despite emailing again, I have received no response despite reminding them that they BA stated she couldn’t fly.
 
We were due to fly to Dalaman from Gatwick on the 7th July.  Just myself and wife travelled via train to Gatwick and due to my wife’s disability we had paid an extra £240 as an upgrade to fly business class.
 
Arrived at Gatwick, to find the flight delayed by 3 hours but we were still booked in.  Just about to go into the club lounge, to find that the flight was cancelled and that it had been moved to the Sunday, but from Heathrow at 7.45am.
 
I went to complain at the desk, but the desk can’t help you as we are not BA staff, you need to speak to BA. I phoned BA, no you need to speak to the desk.  Eventually someone did help and gave me 2 tickets to get to Heathrow on the National Express bus.
 
At Heathrow, they did find us a hotel for the night (the cheapest I could find on any booking site was £500) and also gave us vouchers for food and a form to complete for the cancelled flights.  However, they informed me that as the business class was an upgrade, this meant nothing if the flight was bumped and I am not guaranteed a business flight and I would have to put an additional claim in, to get the money back.  I am still waiting for that £240 to be refunded.
 
The hotel Crowne Plaza, would not honour the food vouchers, as they stated BA had given them a £10 per person budget for a buffet which was inedible and a glass of water each.  Vouchers for breakfast were also not valid as we needed to leave the hotel at 5am and breakfast was not open until 6.30am.
 
The flight on the Sunday was subsequently delayed, another hour wait on the runway.
 
On arriving in Dalaman, my laptop case came on the conveyor belt open, lock and zip bust and subsequently found the fitbit watch in the case missing.  There was no one at the airport to report this to, only 2 customs men who didn’t speak English.
 
The flight back to Gatwick was also delayed by an hour.
 
Basically a number of issues which have left me out of pocket and ruined the holiday in many senses.

You need to speak to customer relations, OK, can I have a number, No, they only respond via email.  I have phoned again tonight to be told I will transfer you a manager to then be cut off.

"The service at both airports was appalling. London Heathrow checkin is automated, I assume do save BA money but many passengers have no idea how to check in or to drop their bags (there are limited and confusing instructions) so long queues develop and no BA staff are around to help.
Meanwhile, Ryan Air checkin which we could see, was fully manned and their passengers were moving quickly. We were delayed for over an hour at bag drop off. On return, the service at Venice airport was even worse. We were delayed again at bag drop off for over an hour while again, there Ryan  Air passengers sailed through and then we found they has a fast path entrance through security. I then realised that paying more to travel with BA rather than a budget airline had been a mistake.

"Dear British Airways Customer Services,
This letter is to express our displeasure and concerns regarding our flight to Tuscany, Italy for a long-awaited 14-day family vacation. Our trip was effectively ruined by the failure of our luggage to arrive with us, coupled with the length of time it took for it to eventually reach us (9 and 12 days)!
Our Record Locator Number is: NIGZX6.  Our departure dates: June 19, 2023 - Flight BA 294, Chicago to London. June 20 -rebooked by BA on BA 546, London to Rome.  All flights were late.
On arrival in Rome, Sehoy (wife) was forced to walk to the check-in desk because our reservation for wheelchair assist from the plane was never transferred by BA. She has a painful spinal fusion and arthritis, but was told by the cabin crew that there was no reservation for her transport.  Also, our checked baggage (2) failed to make the BA rebooked flight from London to Rome.
BA took 9 days to deliver my (Robert’s) bag and 12 days to deliver Sehoy’s. Reminder: This was a 14-day vacation.  I called BA Baggage Claim Services daily. I was frequently cut off after waiting on hold for over an hour.  We had Apple Air tags in both bags, and sent pictures showing their exact location to BA Baggage Claim several times.  After 5 days, BA stated that they found Sehoy’s bag, but needed to verify ownership! Both bags as described had bright pink 4” easily visible tags and bright pink bows.  Taking 9 and 12 days to deliver them is inexcusable.
We were staying in an isolated villa in the hills of Tuscany, an hour from the nearest small town.  We had to purchase clothing and toiletries from the nearest flea market. Sehoy had none of her medications for hypertension, pain, incontinence and diabetes.  Also, none of her mastectomy bras, extra prosthesis, walking poles and incontinence supplies. 
Our return date: July 3 - BA 553, Rome to London. BA 297, London to Chicago.  All flights were late. We arrived in Chicago more than 3 hours late, thereby missing our ground transportation to our home in Michigan (3 hours away). We had to find a hotel and stay overnight near Chicago.
On July 12 we filed our expenses for replacement of lost clothing and toiletries. Case Number: 25254669.  Also, Case Number 25255211, for food purchased at Heathrow due to the flight delay and overnight hotel charges in Chicago.  After 2 weeks, I went online asking for some follow-up on both cases, but have had no response at all from BA.  We are retirees on fixed income, and cannot fund BA’s errors.  We are asking for recompense for our expenses and additional air miles credited to our American Frequent Flyer accounts.   I can honestly say that the times I was able to reach a human being, they were all courteous and attempted to help, but appeared at a loss.
Sincerely,
Robert B. Brown & Sehoy F. Brown",1.0,Chicago,Rome,International,June 2023,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,N/A,3.0

We then waited 9 hours and the kids were extremely tired. We then waited 90 minutes in passport control to get out of the airport and the pilot said there would be a flight at 7am the next day.

The kept pushing back our flight and the pilot eventually said we would be boarding in an hour which never happened, and when it’s rumoudly was cancelled, we saw the pilot and crew leaving the airport without us and then the rest of the passengers would have to wait for ground crew to unload the plane and put the baggage back on the belt which meant another 90 minutes in passport control and then it’s just happened there was a power cut which meant we had to wait an extra 20 minutes and by that time, we booked a flight on Freebird back home. 100% wouldn’t recommend flying unless absolutely last resort",1.0,Antalya,London,Europe,August 2023,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0

"I have never actually been inside a coffin, but having lived in a British Airways standard Club World business class seat for 9 hours, I now know what it must be like.  In fact, I would rather die than experience BA's standard Club World seat again.  

BA offers two types of business class on its long-haul, wide-body planes: Club World, and Club World Suite. They cost the same, and with either, you have to pay to select your seats when booking. I paid almost $300 for Club World Suites on my RT itinerary.  Having flown in Club World Suites before, I was looking forward to experiencing it again. The suites are based on the pod concept, meaning you have an individual space with direct access to the aisle, regardless of your seat number. And a sliding door to enclose you with privacy. These suites are spacious, comfortable and very thoughtfully designed with ample storage, a large and sturdy tray table, a large screen, and easily accessible lights and power outlets. The outbound flight was great. But when I checked in for the return flight to Denver, I discovered the plane had been changed to one that had standard Club World seating, not Club World Suites. What's more, my seat had been changed. I was not notified in advance of either of these changes. 

Here's why you should avoid standard Club World seat at all cost:

1. The standard Club World configuration is 2-3-2 in a ying-yang arrangement (alternating forward and backward facing seats). If you have a window or center seat, you will have to step over your neighbor in order to get into and out of your seat. You will also have to stare into your neighbor's face during boarding, take-off and landing because of the ying-yang arrangement. If you're in an aisle seat, you will have flight attendants constantly bending over you to serve the passenger next to you. 

2. Once in your seat you will feel like you've been hoisted down into a casket. It is narrow compared to other international business class seats, only 20', so getting comfortable, even in the lay-flat position, is virtually impossible, especially if you are 6-feet or taller.  Also, the seat is firm and not at all conducive to rest. 

3. The tray table is impractically small and flimsy, comparable to the tray tables in any economy class. Also, because it folds out from the center console, it is wobbly/bouncy and unstable. You will be in constant fear that your meal and drinks will topple off into your lap. 

4. The one and only storage space is a pull-out bin at the bottom of the console. Not only is it impractically small, but it is also entirely useless when your seat is in the lay-flat position because you have to return your seat fully upright every time you want to access the bin. 

No wonder the president of the OneWorld Alliance has called BA's Club World the worst business class experience in the sky. 

Since BA is notorious for changing planes, much more so than any other airline I've traveled, I have vowed to never again fly BA business class for long-haul travel. It's just too inconvenient and uncomfortable.",2.0,London,Denver,International,July 2023,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,3.0
"On our return leg from Vienna there was a four hour delay.  BA had a problem while we were at the airport with the toilets but after 2.5 hours they boarded us for a further 1.5 hours wait on the plane. One very small bottle of water per person while the business class had snacks and drinks. The staff were rude and unhelpful.  They said you can claim for the delay.  
I put a claim in on my return 27th June 23. They acknowledged the claim with a reference number. Four weeks later 'sorry for the delay'. Seven weeks later still nothing.  It is a straight forward claim for a delay. I got better service from Jet2 who I will be using from now on.",1.0,London,Vienna,Europe,June 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
"1. I missed my connected flight due to my previous flight with British Airways (BA) departing 45 minutes late
2.  BA staff attempted to place me on another flight. I waited for 4 hours to catch that flight but once I got to the gate, they told me I couldn't because my baggage was not there. Major waste of time. 
3. My baggage didn’t make it on the plane. I called over 15 times (accumulating and extra $30 on my bill because of international minutes), before the agent finally escalated my case. I received my baggage 6 days late and didn't have it for the entire duration of my vacation. 
4. When I did receive my baggage, it was damaged. (Picture attached)
5. The flight attendants kept looking over me as if I was invisible, when it was time to pass out meals.
6. Wifi and entertainment system was not working on flight; the system must have been old.
7. My flight heading back was very distrubing. Particular passengers were standing on the aisle and over myself and other passengers, to talk to one another. There were babies crawling down the aisle. The environment was extremely loud and dangerous, for the entire duration of the flight. The crew members did not enforce rules or regulations.

"First time we flew was a good flight, good crew and food. A smooth flight and no delays or cancellations. Overall an enjoyable experience. We expected the same on our return flight however when we got to the desk to check our bags in, an announcement went out to say that the flight had been cancelled due to the captain being ill. A little more warning though! We were lucky enough to already be at the desk to get on another flight but some people had already checked in their bags so we had to therefore go down and collect their bags and go to the back of the queue. We were all worried but after about an hour of waiting to find another flight, they booked us into American Airways so we got a shuttle bus and went to that terminal. However when we got there there was apparently no seats left and they had told British airways hours ago. We were looking for any other flight for about two hours after. Eventually after a helpful member of staff we got a flight the next day but we would only arrive home two days later. Very disappointed about BA’s service in this flight cancellation.

"Absurd.  We had our flight cancelled 4 hours before take off.  British Airways did not automatically re-book us.  We had to call multiple times and wait hours on hold just to speak with an agent.  We were then re-booked but they did it through an airport that was 3 hrs driving from our house.   The rebooking was for 3 days later.  We then had to get on the phone again.  When they finally re-booked us from our home airport it was for 2 days later.  When we changed planes in JFK they said that my 12 year old son did not have a ticket for the final let of the journey.  We spent an hour getting that all resolved and almost missing our connection.  Then the icing on the cake is that British won't refund us our seat selections from the originally cancelled flight because they say we cancelled.  Funny, I wonder if they are trying that with the other 300 people who were at the airport trying to figure out how they were going to get re-booked.   $500 in seat upgrades that they won't refund us.

When we landed, they lost our luggages, no clothes the entire vacation, we have to go out of budget to get new clothes. Their customer service is rude and do not care at all about your issue, they will give you the run around for days with no effort or work. 

At the end of our vacation, they still didn’t find our luggage, and the icing on the cake ? They overbooked their flight. We couldn’t get on our return flight, they made us wait for the next and the next and the next flight, all overbooked, it’s been 3 days we been stuck at London airport, still in the same clothes for 3 days, no shower… waiting for a flight, they still didn’t find our luggage.

"If you are thinking of treating yourself to a First Class ticket, do not buy a BA one. They will manage to ruin your experience. 
While the experience in flight was ok (nothing First Class worthy though), with lousy service and confused attendants. However, that is not why I am sharing my experience. My bag did not get loaded in the flight, and therefore did not arrive with me. While I understand the quirks and risks of traveling, I do not for a second, condone their appalling behavior when we made the claim. They never took responsibility or apologize, they punted the blame onto the connecting flight (which they hadn't even received the bag in the first place), and they had not customer service (let alone one dedicated to first class cabin) nor a method to track the bags. The kicker! they did admit that there was an issue in Heathrow that day. British Airways is the only airline flying out of LHR terminal 5. But just as quick as they were to point at the issue, they were to put the blame on someone else. Defies logic.
And we are now fighting with them to reimburse the costs of buying the clothes for the three days they failed to deliver my luggage. They even had the audacity to request travel insurance policy.
Here is a last thought and question to British Airways. If you cannot track a bag, or allow your flyers to do so (all airlines I currently fly with have that feature on their apps/websites), how safe are you flying their airplanes? I, for one, will not try again. Their systems have proven to be beyond obsolete.",1.0,London,Johannesburg,International,July 2023,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
"Have flown BA many times and used to love them. They are now awful in almost every respect. Last February my wife and I flew to Chile. At check in we were advised by the most rude and unhelpful person ever allowed to deal with the public that our hand luggage had to go in the hold. We pointed out we had medicines and some jewellery and cash, TOUGH, it has to go in the hold. We were then told we could take it on as we were changing flights in Madrid and going on to Santiago!! In Madrid we actually had to run to catch the connecting flight. The seats were so closely packed I couldn't believe it. The food was inedible and when we had the effrontery to ask for a drink were told 'I'm going to the back'! What does that mean?? It means you don't get a drink. When we landed at Santiago my case came out quite quickly, my wife's never did! We went to the BA desk and joined a queue of over 120 people who had lost their cases! It seems that in the rush to catch the connecting flight many of the bags were not loaded. BA were completely unhelpful, the best suggestion offered on getting back the missing bag was 'go to the airport tomorrow and see if it has arrived'! When we tried ringing the number they gave us there were only Spanish speakers. We finally got some help from a Rep in our Hotel who rang them and discovered the bag 'may be arriving tomorrow or may be sent on to your ship in several days'!! We spent most of the day in Santiago shopping for clothes as my wife was dressed for London in Feb 2018(the beast from the east weather) and in Santiago it was 88. We were lucky, her bag was on our Cruise ship when we boarded. One lady we spoke to got her bag several days later, it was broken open as it had been to Miami and unaccompanied was obviously suspect. A gentleman we spoke to coming home told us his bag had been delivered to his home address so he never had it until he returned. Our flight back was Rio to Heathrow. We arrived at the airport and joined an enormous queue, it was moving very slowly and we were nearing the front when a coach load of Brazilians arrived and were immediately shown to the front of the queue! The flight home was awful, worse than going out, seats crushed closely together, food unfit for consumption but we were offered a drink. I swore I would not fly with BA again but unfortunately a package booked in August meant we had to fly BA to Toronto. The flight was ok although the seats were close not so bad as before and food actually edible(just). When we landed no sign of my bag until I found it on a pile of cases yards from where it should be with an enormous dent in it so it was bulging open. We reported it, had to buy straps to keep it from opening. On our return home(we came home by ship) we contacted BA and six weeks later they offered a cheap replacement for my samsonite. I refused and was told 'take it or leave it'. I issued a small claims court summons and they paid with costs. IF YOU CAN POSSIBLY AVOID IT DO NOT FLY WITH BRITISH AIRWAYS. They are penny pinching, and not as good as average, their current Chief Exec has turned a world renowned brand into a joke, they are not as good as some of the budget airlines and it is a real shame.

"First time flying British Airways and our last time. My family of 5 started our experience with British canceling our international flight. 

Customer service to get us back on track was the worst I’ve ever experienced. We were told that we needed to go to American Airlines to get rebooked. American agent was super mad because they don’t own the ticket and all the people they pushed over to their counter caused their actual passengers to miss flights because of the super long lines. 
We eventually got rebooked back with British after a crazy about of calls to customer service. 

As far as the extra couple of thousand dollars $$ I paid to upgrade everyone’s seats I was told sorry but you lost that. 
No way to get what we paid for. Also agent told us that they changed the airfare code on our tickets to reflect an upgrade (for our coach seats) and there would be no way to get the money. How horrible is this airline. 

Finally, we board our flight back in coach. Ok, been here before…but my seat did not have a working screen. Flight attendant reset system a couple of times and said it’s broke. Uggg. My daughter next to me had a broken seat that would not recline on our 9 hour flight. 

We thought since they are part of the One World Alliance they would have same high standards as American Airlines. Not the case. I would say If you book a flight with them set the expectations that it operates like a budget airline.  Why, because as I use my flight tracker app to can see that extraordinary number of canceled flights from all major airports.

"Overbooking issue
11 AUG 2023 BA680 HEATHROW LONDON > ISTANBUL FLIGHT;

I had a terrible day because of british airways's overbooked flight. I wasn't expecting from BA I was thinking its very big and very good quality airlines but I'm very disappointed. 

What happened I explained below.

Firstly i bought my ticket 1st of July and on the day of my flight, I arrived to airport 3 hours before my flight when I arrived there I went to drop of my luggage the guy on counter said your ticket is 'standby' that was I heard first time in my life he said that 'you should wait on the gate and if there is any possibility you will get on the plane' I said fine and also I paid for my luggage he wanted £140 but on the email I checked £75 I showed him he dropped price to £75 pound he tried to cheat me. 
And then when I pass from the searching area I went to BA customer service there was a guy I told him what happened, he said he will sort it out and give new ticket after 20min I waited there 20min the time was 17:30 exactly I went to desk there was no him and I gave my ticket to him, I stayed ticketless there was another lady I explained everything and she gave me new ticket in was writing on it seat no: GATE. Anyway I went to gate I waited all people gone to airplane me and there was another lady we left there we couldn't get on to airplane. after everyone gone I asked them 'whats going to happen they refuse to answer me', I wanted my luggage they said your luggage in airplane. Because I need to get my luggage from them. They even didn't offer me another flight. I booked another flight from Stansted. I paid stansted flight. And also I had appointment at hospital and also I booked a rent a car they canceled and I paid another transfers to Stansted.

*How can BA sells my seat to someone else is this fair?
*How can they not answer me on the gate is this possible? They were thinking like I am their enemy they were looking like that.
*How can they not help customer service desk for another flight? What are they doing there.",1.0,London,Istanbul,Europe,August 2023,N/A,N/A,N/A,1.0,1.0,N/A,1.0,N/A

"Be began our journey will British Airways by flying from Barcelona the London.  In Barcelona, they were offering free checking of carry on that would make it to Boston.   If offered this-REFUSE!!!  Our flight to Boston was supposed to leave at 20:10-The staff came on and told us that we would be leaving 15-20 minutes later than scheduled due to a 'sick passenger and his family' needing their luggage taken off of the plane.

"British Airways used to be fantastic; no longer I am afraid.  We were booked from Cincinnati to London on a route that was trumpeted as a huge deal locally. I was excited; I've been a British Airways enthusiast for more than a decade, flying from Chicago or Atlanta in First or Business Class depending on what was available.  HOW WRONG I WAS.

The Cincinnati to London flight was cancelled for 'operational' reasons -- I was told by an agent for British Airways they needed to plane for a busier route.  Then they rebooked us flying out of Chicago the next day at a 7 AM flight that was impossible to make the connection.  Then they rebooked us on an American Airlines flight from Cincinnati to Boston, with British Airways flying to Heathrow.  Of course, the American Airlines plane was going to be late (apparently that was known 8 hours before the flight was to take off), so our connection window dwindled from 3 hours, to 2 hours, to 28 minutes.  

I spent 8 hours on the phone with British Airways (in all fairness, most of that time was spent on hold because they have understaffed their Customer Service Departments).  I was passed from department to department as everyone said that it wasn't something they could assist with; supervisors were never available to escalate the call to get a resolution.  Customer Service agents routinely lied to me about seats on potential replacement flights that they claimed were not available, but that I could clearly see were available on the British Airways app and when confronted with that information, they would then admit that the seats were available, but that I could not have them.

The ultimate resolution only came from AMERICAN AIRLINES; yes, you read that right, the sad American carrier that is known for incessant delays and horrible customer service.  It's sad when the American carrier that got stuck with us is better at customer service that the British carrier that we booked with, but here we are.

So, in short, do not under any circumstances even try to fly on British Airways again.  Even if you have had wonderful experiences in the past (I sure have), those experiences are clearly over as the company seeks to juice as much profits as possible and tell customers to $*-! off.

"BA is litteraly my least favorite airline, from the on-line experience (forget using the app on ipad, a JOKE, NOTHING can be done), to the antiquated business class layout, to seats which won’t fold, to rude agents who curtly tell business class customers “we have every right to leave the gate 10 minutes early” when that group (10 or more) of passengers missed the flight due to a delay, and BA chose to roll early…not even an apology…REALLY hard to imagine a worse way to run an airline. I am sitting on an airbust 380 (the bust is not a typo). The seat layout in business is absolutely unbelievable. The “lay flat” seats don’t have leg lift support or foot rest, the center seats are blocked if outside seats go to sleep, the window seats are also land locked. There is zero storage, and BA is “kind” enough to give you a full sized pillow, and blanket bag, which must be shoved into the overhead compartment during takeoff, as there is no storage. Seats are about as wide as economy, maybe an inch wider. The divider wall between seats is opaque, but still HIGHLY viewable…JUST a miserable miserable situation.

So you're about 2 feet away from a stranger, looking straight at them. There's a plastic partition between you that is lowered for takeoff and landing, but even raised it provides minimal privacy.

This caused us to miss our connecting flight and therefore a whole day of our holiday as could not get a flight to America until the next day.

"British Airways have really gone down hill to the point where they are bottom of the barrel now. I've flown with them my whole life, and have never seen such rubbish for such a high price. In the old days, you'd pay a substantial price but at least you'd get benefits with the ticket. 

I flew economy (standard airbus flight) and was astonished to find the CEO has made even more cutbacks, I assume to maximise profits, and pocket a little more for himself. Instead of getting a bottle of harrogate water, the cabin crew filled up a plastic cup halfway with water from the bottle. So now we've resorted to sharing a 2l bottle amongst ourselves? If you wanted more, you had to pay £3.00 for a small bottle... laughable!!!!!!

As well as this the food menu is nothing short of pretentious and pathetic. Tom Kerridge's food is rubbish to say the least. £4.50 for a sandwich and it tasted like cardboard. There aren't many options for children. My son wanted a sandwich and had to have the adult £4.50 smoked ham and cheddar sandwich, because the kids box was just full of quizzes, pencils, biscuits and breadsticks - hardly a meal for a child. Quite a few things had run out as well, which didn't leave much. The same menu applies on the way home. When we flew home from Tenerife, it was the evening and there were no proper dinner options. I had to have a scone and a bacon roll for dinner. Would you say that's a standard evening meal? I think bloody not. 

The tickets are massively overpriced and unfortunately they know people are desperate enough to pay. I would suggest to people to try easyJet dependent on your location. I used them last year and they had a wide range of foods on the flight, fully stocked, service was great and it was cheap and cheerful! BA need to take a hard look at themselves and see how poor they've become. 

It's a luxury price for a budget experience unfortunately!!! 

Even business class has taken a hit. There's nothing decent in the club kitchen anymore and it's 1 free meal. My brother flew 13 hours and had 1 meal. that's disgraceful, considering you robbed him blind. For the price you charged, there should have been 2 free meals and snacks, much like it used to be. 

There's nothing elite or prestigious about this airline anymore. It's lost it's touch and you can thank the CEO for that.

"I am writing to express my deep dismay and utter disgust with the deplorable treatment I received during my recent travel with your airline. As a 76-year-old passenger, I expected a basic level of respect and care, but instead, I endured a harrowing ordeal that left me stranded at JFK airport for a staggering 29 hours without any assistance.

To start, I was appalled to find that despite the inconvenience caused by weather conditions, British Airways provided no alternative arrangements such as hotel accommodation, food vouchers, or transportation to a hotel during this extended layover. The lack of empathy and disregard for my well-being during this distressing period is utterly unacceptable.

Furthermore, my travel plans were marred by the cancellation of not one but two connecting flights to my final destination. The level of incompetence displayed by your airline in handling these disruptions is beyond comprehension. It resulted in significant inconvenience, wasted time, and undue stress, all of which should not be the burden of the paying passenger.

To add insult to injury, British Airways also cancelled my return flight home, which was a direct flight to Heathrow. The fact that your airline refused to rebook me on another direct flight unless I paid an additional £170 is an outrage. I had already paid for the service, and your unilateral decision to impose additional fees in this dire situation is simply unjust.

I can assure you that my experience with British Airways has left a lasting negative impression on me and my family, who were gravely concerned for my well-being during the prolonged ordeal. The lack of compassion, accountability, and professionalism displayed by your airline is utterly deplorable.

I demand an immediate and thorough investigation into the series of failures that marred my journey and a sincere, comprehensive apology for the anguish and inconvenience I endured.

But today with no particular weather problems to blame and with a flight originating from London, my flight has already been delayed twice and is now scheduled to leave nearly 4 hours after its original departure time.  Unacceptable!    If they can’t run their airline any better than this, they should do the honorable thing and close their doors and go out of business.",1.0,London,New York City,International,July 2023,N/A,N/A,N/A,1.0,N/A,N/A,1.0,N/A
Check in and security via fast track was great as was the lounge experience once you found it. However boarding was a fiasco - after being invited to board we were kept standing in the aerobridge - yes the aerobridge with little ventilation for 35 minutes because BA had discovered that the aircrew already on the plane did not have the right experience. After replacement crew boarded we the unlucky paying passengers were finally allowed to board only to find that business class is just 3 economy seats with the middle seat filled by a tray. The seat was narrow and uncomfortable and had MINIMUM recline if at all. Boarding took forever as basically every passenger had too much carry on luggage. Due to the late boarding we had missed our take-off slot so had to wait a further 20 minutes for another one. The only saving grace was the captain who apologised and explained the situation and the replacement crew whose service was exemplary. We landed an hour late. BA management and Gatwick Ground staff that allowed the aerobridge fiasco should be admonished and retrained in basic customer service and administration.,1.0,London,Bari,Europe,July 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0
I THINK BA IS THE WORST AIRLINE IN THE WORLD. HAVE BEEN ON 3 FLIGHTS RECENTLY AND THE LAST ONE WAS DELAYED BY 4 HOURS FOR A SHORT FLIGHT FROM AMSTERDAM TO LONDON. SPENT MORE TIME WAITING IN AIRPORT THEN ON ACTUALLY FLIGHT. WILL NEVER FLY ON BA AGAIN. WORST AIRLINE EVER,1.0,Amsterdam,London,Europe,July 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
"I booked a flight with BA to travel from Gibraltar to London Heathrow on May 10, 2023. My flight was scheduled to leave at 4:00 p.m. in the afternoon. I had originally planned on leaving my luggage at Heathrow upon arrival and travelling to visit and overnight at my cousin's place. En route to GIB airport a few hours prior to departure, I checked my flight details and found out that my flight had been cancelled. I had a connecting flight booked with Westjet from London Heathrow to Vancouver the following day and I had to make that flight, so it was imperative that I got to London. I checked the BA website and couldn't find any other flights with them that would work, so unfortunately I made the mistake of requesting a refund. I managed to find a flight out of Malaga that got me into London just after 10:00 p.m. so I booked that and then called British Airways as I wanted to discuss compensation. That's when they advised me that because I had requested a refund (they used the phrase 'abandoned' travel with them), they were not prepared to do anything for me. Apparently, I should have called them first, and then they would have made the arrangements. Of course they don't explain that on their website - they just ask if you want a refund and then proceed. And even when I plead my case with the agent at Malaga airport and then followed up with Customer Relations several times via email, they flat out refused to budge. 

I had used a travel voucher to cover the cost of my flight and had used Avios to cover the cost of my checked baggage, so in other words no out of pocket costs for the trip. Once this incident happened, I ended up spending 660 euros in airfare and checked baggage charges to get to London from Malaga (i.e., different airport than the one I had originally booked from). And because the luggage storage facility at Heathrow had closed by the time I eventually arrived, I ended up booking a night at a hotel since I couldn't travel by train to my cousin's place any longer (3 bags in tow) and I didn't want to put him out and have him drive to the airport to pick me up. This cost me another £125 in room and meal costs. All BA ended up doing to compensate me was to give me 5,000 free Avios - a mere pittance compared to my out of pocket expenses.

Despite trying to explain to them why I requested the refund instead of calling them first, they wouldn't budge. Very easy for them to say what I should have done since they work there and know the rules and they weren't the ones scrambling to find alternative travel arrangements within a few hours. I pointed out that on their website they should simply instruct customers to call them when this situation happens, and that way they would never encounter this problem. My feeling is that they put the refund option out there in the hope that customers will make the mistake I did so they can then wash their hands of the situation and ultimately save money. I've been an Executive Club member for years and they simply didn't care. They said there was nothing they could do, but I think that's total crap. I'm sure if one of the BA executive's friends or family members had gone through this, staff there would have been given the instruction to make things right. 

I used to be a fan of BA but they have really gone downhill in my opinion. Once I used up my remaining Avios and travel credit, I will cancel my Executive Club membership and never fly with them again.",1.0,Gibraltar,London,Europe,May 2023,N/A,N/A,N/A,1.0,1.0,N/A,N/A,N/A

"Have taken a flight from London to Ibiza this morning, 28th of July 2023. I chose Business class to have the confort of a quieter cabin and some easy boarding. 
In today's flight, the cabin service director decided that all economy class passenger could use the toilets at the front of the plane even tough the toilets at the back were in perfect use state. For the 2 hour flight, there has been a group of people standing in the front of the plane waiting for the toilet, with the distraction and the noise that this creates for the ones at front wanting to work.
I don't understand some of the decisions BA personnel takes, specially the cabin service directors that shall be properly trained. Business class tickets are really expensive compared to discounted economy seats. There are not many advantages of paying for this extra amount on a 2 hours European flight. If the little advantages are eliminated, as a more confortable cabin with a quieter environment, is the difference in fair really justified?
BA used to be my favourite airline. I am a EXECUTIVE CLUB Gold member for life. Over the years, other airlines have really taken BA over. This is a shame.

"British Airways cancelled our flight without any notification. We only found out when we went to the gate prior to boarding. Then they said we would fly to London, stay the night and continue to the final destination. THEN, all of a sudden we were re-booked on Level airlines, which is like the easy jet of long haul carriers. We were originally booked with British Air in World Traveler Plus which is the premium cabin of British Air long haul flights. Now, on Level Air, we were seated in economy and separated. We found out once on the plane that we did not have a meal on the 11.5 hr flight because Level Air is a pre flight order meal type thing. Since we didn't book with Level, we didn't have a meal. After the 1st meal service I pled my case to a flight attendant in the back and she gave us a leftover meal.

When we purchased the tickets, I mistakenly entered my name twice (e.g. Mr John Smith and Ms John Smith). Little did we know that our 1 this simple mistake would cost us over 300 pounds.

Upon arriving at the airport we were told there was no way to change the name (apparently they can only change 3 letters where there has been a typo?) and I had no other option to purchase the last remaining ticket if I wanted to board the flight - the price: almost seven times (!) higher than my original ticket. Zero empathy was shown. Zero alternative was offered. Trusting BA's staff and under the pretence that there was apparently no other way we could board the flight we bought this ticket. 

Immediately after I purchased the ticket I contacted BA's 'Commercial Change Booking Team' and informed them of our situation. The service representative apologised and told me they could have changed the name at the cost of a small fee. He offered to cancel my original ticket and issue me a partial refund then, advising me that I had a claim to the difference and I should contact Customer Support to do so. I told this person several times I wanted to claim the cost of the new ticket and even asked him explicitly if by accepting this offer, I would be denied from claiming the cost of the new ticket. He said no, I could claim the difference. Fair enough - we accepted this offer and lodged a ticket with Customer Support for the difference.

Two days later, British Airways Customer Response informed us that we were unable to lodge a claim because we had 'voluntarily accepted the cancellation before the flight'. 

So in short, British Airways misled and deceived my partner into accepting a lowball offer to waive our right to claim a refund. It keeps me up at night thinking how they can do this and get away with it so easily. I have thousands of student debt and cannot afford to just accept paying 300 pounds for nothing. This has been keeping us up at night. We won't let this one go even though their Customer Service seems to have lost interest and stopped responding.",1.0,London,Frankfurt,Europe,July 2023,1.0,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
"Boarding at Aberdeen was disorganised. They asked us to board at the front of the plane when our seats were at the back. They asked those seated in the middle of the plane to board at the back. You can imagine the queues inside the plane.! The international leg left on time. No hot drinks on offer for me, but those sitting to my left got as they were served by another crew member! The return journey was the same. Food choices ran out (although the fish curry was actually good) . I overheard a crew member telling a customer “I cannot just magic up some beef for you” and as soon as the meal was served they dimmed the lights (it was a daytime flight!). Premium Economy with Virgin a MUCH better experience. BA talk about every “experience is more than a flight. It’s about making every single journey as special and original as you are, whatever your reason to travel”. This experience was not special at all.

"I paid for and confirmed my flight plan in Oct. 2022 for several BA flights in June 2023.  Six weeks before I was to leave BA advised that one leg of my flight was cancelled.  This left me to their mercy of switching my flight to another airport about 50 miles away with no reimbursement for transportation cost when I initially could have taken an inexpensive cab ride.  To make matters worse, the gate crew were always rude and consistently lied about the overhead bin space being full.  They used this ruse to try to coerce/encourage people to voluntarily check their bags.  One lady told me she checked personally and there was no space.  I took my chances and did not check my bag.  Once on board, as I suspected, the bins were mostly empty.  At Heathrow, one gate attendant threatened the passengers saying that people would be identified and required to check their bags and had no choice.  Another crew member demanded that I check my bag because there was no more space and wanted to see my boarding pass.  When I said I needed to take out my medication, she said never mind, keep my bag.  I guess the bin space wasn't full after all.  What a bunch of rude, lying flight crew.

"It is ridiculous that I book a BA flight out of Heathrow and then cannot check in online because it's a codeshare flight on Iberia. Then I get kicked to an Iberia website that is in Spanish so I don't know what I'm doing. Then when I work my way through it I can't get a boarding pass so still have to check in at the airport. then when I get to the Gold check in at Heathrow T5 they can't do it so I have to go to the other end of the airport to check in with Iberia.

Then when I go through to the lounge, well it just gets worse. I am absolutely appalled at the degeneration in the quality of service and the product BA offers. As a gold customer using the first class lounge I was astounded to discover that all that is now available by way of food is the buffet. I wouldn’t expect this quality in the business class lounge let alone the first class lounge!!! This quality is no better than I would expect in a 2 star hotel or cheap diner! why do you bother keep sending me useless surveys about food choices and service preferences if all you are going to do is steadily remove any semblance of quality. more and more you are forcing me to fly with an alternative airline.

"Terrible experience.
I booked my tickets to Ibiza in the new year, all good so far, then a few days before my holiday I booked my parking at Gatwick as that is where I was flying from, which cost £75. Twelve hours before my flight was due for departure I had an SOS message saying my flight had cancelled, BA found a flight from City but wanted to check other flights before booking City Airport by the time after I checked City was fully booked, so I lost my parking payment and a days holiday, there were only flights from Heathrow.
Most of my holidays I have booked with BA.
I will never use BA again, absolutely a terrible experience.

"The trauma that I have experience today at the hands of your airline is incomprehensible. I am still in shock. And when I say trauma I mean that I will remember this day forever as not only the worst travel experience I’ve ever had but one of the worst days of my life. The incompetence, and it’s rampant in all directions. Do not be fooled by this airline. Absolutely god awful. Where to begin:
1. Flight was booked first class and they added my infant but neglected to actually issue a ticket to her. We didn’t know any better, when we booked initially we trusted the process not anticipating the ball being dropped by the airline in such a massive way. So we nearly missed the flight but, luckily we devoted 3 hours of our vacation to customer service where some nice ladies in ticketing were able to recover this massive error and save the flight for us. Onto the next error…
2. This one is minor but still highlights the incompetence and is a piece of the story. On its own; its minor but connected with the rest of our experience it is significant. So - our baby’s stroller was gate checked and we were told it would be at the bottom of the flight when we de boarded. But instead of bringing it to us like they said, I waited outside on the tarmac for it until they determined that they actually sent it through to baggage claim.  I love holding my baby but she is 10 months and pretty heavy for my after a while. Going through customs and waiting on bags added up to 45 mins to an hour of straight holding her while juggling bags. I almost dropped her several times because my arms were simply giving out. It was beyond difficult. I didn’t plain to use her carrier or anything because, again, we trusted what we were told and we thought we would have the stroller. 
3. Next - 1st flight was booked from NYC to LHR, but our connection to final destination was from Gatwick airport. This was organized by the airline and we trusted what was sold to us and their process again. So we took a $190 transfer taxi to the other airport after we landed only to find out they canceled the flight. So we arrive to the airport with no flight but we’re rebooked with my husband leaving tonight and me and my baby leaving tomorrow…. So our family was separated?  Mind you both flights were set to leave from the airport we just came from. 
4. We go to agents to ask for help and spent 2 hours there to ultimately be told “youve been helped” ie flights listed above, which would clearly be unacceptable for parents traveling abroad with a infant under a year.  Plus at that point we were offered no hotel accommodations, no vouchers for food, no transfer service, nothing) and we’re told “my shift is ending so I’m leaving” and we were just dumbfounded. So we took another $200 transfer back to first airport.  Mind you all long this entire time we’re calling the help line, where for the first hour we were told it was closed (automated recording saying it was down). It finally worked, but we were hung up on - and i counted - 9 times. Not like out of anger - but maybe just laziness, or not knowing what to do, or maybe their phone service and technology is that unreliable. Each time we called back only to go through the tortuous exercise of retelling the situation), only to no avail and to just be hung up on mid-conversation. 
5. We get back to LHR and were told we could fly standby, but earliest we could get on a flight was tomorrow. The agents there offered food and hotel. And when we said we were going to lose our car rental and lose a night of prepaid hotel, we were just told to “submit a claim” with no real details or reassurance or timeline for refund or that it actually worked. 
6. We agreed to try for standby so we waited where we were told for 2 additional hours. We stayed within eye sight of agents in standby area, and kept checking with them every few mins and came back each time we were told to see if there were any updates. At the final closing chance, they told us they had gotten us seats. So we pack the baby all up and set up our bags only to find out “oh sorry I was looking at tomorrows flight - you’re booked on that one”… 
7. Then another girl came out sometime later and said “actually they’ve just told me we can get you through tonight” so we check all our bags and rush to security only to be denied entrance because it was “too late”. The left hand clearly does not communicate with the right hand around here. And to top it off, Ironically, they had already sent all our bags through. 
8. That above was at 7:45pm and it is now 10:45pm and my infant has been here all day and we have still not been able to claim our bags back. My baby has no food, no formula, no more diapers because the rest of what she needed was in our checked luggage which we were supposed to already have access to by now. SOMEWHERE between the millionth errors of this incompetent airline they have actually LOST our luggage even though we have gone NO WHERE. 
9. In addition to the above, just to drive it home, when my husband went to baggage inquiries to try and retrieve the missing luggage initially, he had our carry-on bags with him. As one would. When he got there, they told him that they had to individually search our carry-on luggage for whatever reason that no one will explain to me. At the time, I was waiting at a coffee shop with my baby because she was sleeping (finally).  But I soon got a call from my husband telling me the agents told him that if I didn’t come down there to get my items that they were going to “destroy the bags”. Something about him not being allowed to go through where he needed to go to pick up the bags (that they sent in error) bringing our carry on luggage… even though it had already passed security 3 times this experience. I’m still at a loss and truly shocked that I would be told my things were going to be destroyed. Why would that language be used, especially considering the context of the situation.  
10. The luggage is still lost and it is 11pm. We have spent far too much money to have an experience like this and for no one to be accountable to make amends and fix it in a way that feels fair and appropriate to the damaged caused. This was my first ever flight with my baby and I feel like this airline stole something extremely significant from my life. 
11. Update - they finally found our bags and it’s 11:10pmBut naturally, in seemingly true BA fashion, the shuttle they gave us a voucher for to the hotel had its last run at 11pm.",1.0,London,Nice,Europe,July 2023,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
"UPDATE TO MY PREVIOUS BRITISH AIRWAYS REVIEW - 'Never again fly British Airways” - LOST LUGGAGE: The saga continues. After waiting 5 days with no luggage in Manchester then Liverpool - and after receiving 3 text messages indicating 3 separate delivery times that were MISSED by the courier contracted by BA to deliver my luggage,  I received notice from the courier that he was 'Unable to Deliver' - with no further explanation given as to 'why' that was the case. I decided to return home without my luggage after receiving 5 emails in a row from BA the very next morning requesting me to re-identify my luggage since it was truly lost. This makes exactly NO SENSE AT ALL!!!  Then, British Airways actually CHARGED me to change my return flight, and it was THEY who originally lost my luggage!!! IT GETS WORSE - YOU CANNOT MAKE THIS UP: The very next day my luggage showed up unannounced at the hotel I was staying at in Liverpool, so I immediately changed my flights back to the original dates - and was CHARGED BY BRITISH AIRWAYS YET AGAIN!!! After disputing the 2 separate charges on my Visa credit card, BA denied the dispute, so I am reactivating the dispute and am therefore still in limbo with almost $600 worth of charges.

"What a terrible airline BA has become. The boarding was chaotic, even though it was T5, supposedly their 'home'. Although they say you can take two pieces of cabin baggage on, they were confiscating bags to put in the hold. Thankfully my wife and I only had small underseat bags, but they seem to have forgotten that passengers had PAID for the convenience of taking 2 bags. We were supposed to board in groups, but the gate attendants seemed to lose track of which groups they were boarding. When there were only 3 of us left in the waiting area, I walked up and said 'Can we get on now?' 'Oh, yes.' They bussed us out to the aircraft, but only one door was in use, so there was more chaos getting everyone on.

When I got to the check in at Qatar for my flight to Brisbane I was told BA had cancelled my flight because of a no show. I had to get a train to Terminal 5 to speak to someone at their help desk. I explained the situation about the trains being cancelled but to absolutely no avail. Their bottom line was as I had missed my first flight the whole itinerary was cancelled, including the return flights. I even tried to appeal to them saying I was going to visit family members in Australia I hadn't seen for two years due to covid but again they weren't interested.

"My fiancé and I were flying from JFK to Mykonos with a 65 minute layover in Heathrow. On board we asked a flight attendant to assist us because we had such a short layover. She could not tell us which gate to go or any information about Heathrow. We landed 25 minutes late and by the time we deboarded the plane and ran to security for our gate we had 20 minutes left before our flight. 

Upon scanning our boarding passes we were unable to enter security. A woman from British Airways told us to wait on a line for customer service if we cannot scan our boarding pass. We explained our flight departs soon, but she said we still had to wait on line. The line was at least 100 people long, with similar problems and missed connections. We ask another British Airways employee if she can assist us without us needed to wait on line, potentially missing our flight. She said to rescan the boarding pass, and if it doesnt work, someone near the scanner can help. Once again we scan them and they are still not working. Finally we find a third employee who brings us to a security guard at a computer to scan our boarding passes. He informs us that British Airways cancelled our ticket because we did not pass through security within 30 minutes of our flight (despite knowing our first flight was still mid-air at that time). We asked when the next flight to Mykonos from Heathrow was and he told us that our original flight was the last one for the day. Once again we are redirected to the 100+ person line that has now grown even more.

We waited on line and realized that no one from British Airways was able to help us. We had no where to stay in London and no flight to Mykonos. We also were about to lose our hotel room in Mykonos if we didn't check in that day. 

We paid for airport Wi-Fi and luckily found the last two seats to Mykonos with Aegean airlines at $400. Desperate, we paid for it and ran to the gate for Aegean.

"Bottom Line: American Airlines together with British Airlines overbook their flights and operate with very narrow connection layovers, resulting in missed connections and baggage delays.

The flights were initially booked through Expedia from Tampa, FL to Athens, Greece and back 7/8/23 to 7/18/23 (American Airlines marketed through British Airlines).

With two connections on the journey there was a very tight connection window (35 min) and our flights left late from the original cities in both cases. There was no possible way to get to the connecting gate on time. We tried our best and were turned away to customer service. It was a very challenging journey in total, and our bags were lost upon getting to our final destination in Athens. I also had heart medication in the bags, so didn't have the medication for two days while climbing steep hills. It was very inconvenient not having clothes or items for grooming.

After returning to Hong Kong, we sent emails to Skyscanner and Cheaptickets to complain about not being able to check in for the inbound flight. However, they simply replied that British Airways had confirmed that we were no-shows for our flight, which is not true. Although it was the airline’s responsibility for not allowing us to check-in, it was unacceptable for Cheaptickets, not to provide customer service on weekends. If they had helped us declare that our tickets were in good order, we could have boarded the plane.

We followed the instructions provided by British Airways customer service to obtain proof for insurance or a claim, but the airline only sent us proof that the tickets were booked but we had not traveled with them. We were provided with ticket numbers and booking numbers, yet we were still unable to board the flight. Even after a month, we have received no response to explain this issue. And  no refund also.

We are extremely disappointed with the service we received from British Airways and cheapticket and we demand an explanation as to why we were unable to board our flight despite having valid tickets .",1.0,Madrid,Hong Kong,International,June 2023,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

"We flew to Portugal from New York City with a stopover in London.  Our return flight from London was canceled a month before our trip and we've had to rebook our return trip by extending our entire trip by one day.  There were no other flights that worked for the same day without enduring extremely long stopovers.  Our return flights had to be booked for the following day instead.  
On the day of our flight from New York, we tried to check-in online five hours before our departure, only to find out that the flight to London was cancelled and there was ZERO notification!  We ended up on an earlier flight that barely left room to make it to the airport.  If we didn't' book this flight then the next flight would be the following day and we would have lost one whole day (hotel was already booked and paid for, non-refundable!)  We were all seated separately when we expressly paid more to be able to choose our seats in advance so that we can sit together with our child.  But because of the cancellation, the flight that we were on was 100% booked.  Never again will I fly this airline.

"Our BA Airbus A380 developed a fault taxiing to the runway - we returned to the gate only to then have the flight cancelled about 3 hours later due to a technical fault. All the while, BA staff were virtually non-existent, it was finally the captain who actually announced the flight was cancelled. BA provided an alternative the next day involving a connection but it was very much take this or else you were on your own. No arrangements or help made with overnight accommodation or transport, BA didn't seem to care less at all. Finally managed to get the legal minimum £520 compensation out of BA for the 26 hour delay they caused to my journey, and expenses were reimbursed too, but even this took four weeks. The fact that as a Business Class customer BA pays the minimum they can get away with says it all - they couldn't care less about customers, have no interest in loyalty and aren't bothered about your business.

"Poor communication to begin with !  Flight was delayed and they knew in advance but did not inform passengers until it was almost the time we should have taken off but we’re still in the lounge.  When asked what’s happening was repeatedly told you will be boarding in a few minutes (it was well over an hour later) one person checking the whole plane which obviously took forever, once we were all on board we had to wait for the air conditioning to be rectified - then we had to wait for a slot.   Our Business Class ticket which we purchased to have priority boarding was a joke - we were bussed to the plane and it was a free for all - we just about managed to squeeze our bags in the overhead lockers because they were available to anyone who got there first !   No Champagne on board the hostess said ‘sorry but there is a shortage of Champagne’ news to us we haven’t had any problems.  Our return flight was also delayed and my daughter text us from England to tell us but no one at Nice airport had any information‘apparently’ - once again a free for all to board and our luggage had to be stowed far from our seat.  Food was served and we were so lucky as the rows behind us in Business Class were only offered the vegetarian option as the lamb stew had run out (that is unacceptable) one guy in front of us didn’t want any main course so they really were short on food.  So we eagerly waited for our Champagne which we had been deprived of on the way out - yes they have it but it was us not drinkable - it was corked!  We handed it back and we’re offered a choice of two wines we took the Chardonnay we were asked if we wanted ice in our wine ???  Anyway that too was awful so we didn’t drink it - how can BA hold their heads up.  We paid an awful lot of money for a bit more leg room - could have saved ourselves 50% of the cost quite easily.

"This was the worst travel experience I have every had.

On the way to Dublin, we had a tight 2 hour layover. When we arrived there were issues finding a gate, and then we had to take shuttled to the actual airport. This process took ~45 minutes and by the time we made it to security checks - running to catch out flight - they refused to let us pass and forced us to get a new flight. Unfortunately, a youth group of >30 kids was in the same boat as us. All flights to Dublin for that day were full so we were all stuck in London for the evening. Since the airline (rightly) prioritizes finding accommodations for minors, my husband and I were left to pay for ours ourself and use the claim process to get reimbursed. We were all but sured our claim would be accepted - it of course was not. So now we are not only out the money for the hotel we missed in Dublin, but also out the money for the hotel in London - despite airport staff not allowing us through.

You would think this is all, but on the way back to the States our flight was completely cancelled - WITH NO WARNING OR EMAIL. We only found out because we happened to try to check in 24 hours early. We proceeded to spend over 4 hours on the phone to get a new flight. Of course, all flights for the next day were booked so we god stuck in Dublin for the night.

"How can the FAA approve the seating on British Airways for international travel? I've been squished in before, but on shorter domestic flights. Never have I been so cramped on an international flight, and I am a small person at just 4'11'. For nine hours I could not reach my under-the-seat bag nor my phone, which slid behind my seat while I was sleeping. Sitting upright, the seat in front of me was less than my two hands' width, placing my thumb on my nose, my other thumb on my pinky, and my other pinky against the screen. I could not bend forward to reach my bag.  Because I was on an overnight flight, I had unpacked my travel pillow, earphones, eye mask and slippers before take-off. However, after I awoke I could not put my sleep gear away, nor could I retrieve my laptop, snacks, Kleenex, or cord for charging my dead phone. I suppose I could've wakened my seatmates and asked them to get out of their seats so I could bend over to open my bag, but I refused to make them as uncomfortable as I was. Because of my miserable experience, I paid to select a better seat on my return flight. However, I was dismayed when I boarded the plane and found that I was booked in the middle seat of the middle section and not the two-seat row I had requested and paid for ($304 for my husband and I). I am still waiting for settlement of that discrepancy. I will never fly British Airways for an international flight ever again.

"While the flight and the service on board was very good, I have had a nightmare experience due to damage to my checked luggage. Since I did not have the original receipt for the bag, British Airways will only reimburse me $37, which is 50% of the estimated value of the bag. They advise that this is due to “depreciation“. To add insult to injury, they also are not reimbursing me for $10.67 that was charged by a local luggage firm to inspect the bag to determine if it was repairable or not. (British Airways had instructed me to do that.)

The entire experience has been extremely frustrating. After spending over $3,000 for tickets for my husband and me, I am quite surprised about how British Airways treats their customers whose luggage is damaged by them. We certainly will not be flying with BA again.

Obviously impossible because we were all together right from the start and we did everything together, including check-in, also because we didn't arrive as illegal immigrants until London.
Luckily, at least the 3 who left were 1 mother and 2 children, think if they let the boys leave alone or mixed in any other way.
Initially they also wanted to make me pay for the overnight stay in London and the transport to get to the hotel, after I got very upset and showed them the tag of our bags that had checked in up to Los Angeles, but only 4 people had missed and we still don't know why, so at least they paid for the overnight stay, in a nightmare place moreover.
So in addition to having lost 1 day of hotel and the various things booked in Los Angeles, I also lost the money from the car reservation, since I had used my credit card and driving licence, and the 3 people who arrived in Los Angeles for first they were unable to collect it, because they give the car only to those who booked it, so they had to rent everything again, obviously paying the price more expensive and losing everything paid for the previous reservation in my name.

Group or 4 retirees traveling in World Traveler plus (Premium LHR to HongKong).

Went to check in for flight BA 829 Flight Dublin London at 19.05 on 18/06/23 for flight departing at 17.25 following day.

Amazed to see red sign “Flight Cancelled” across the screen.

BA CONTACTS

At same time got text message from BA informing us of the cancellation but we did not see it, we were concentrating on trying to call BA. Tried calling 4 times. First 3 times got a message that lines were busy and they could not take our call. Fourth time (8 pm) got a message “lines closed” call back tomorrow. 

Meantime my wife called a Dublin number and after a number of tries got through to BA. Person who answered the phone could not be understood, despite my wife and I both trying to understand (on speaker). We were first offered an alternative flight with Aer Lingus at lunchtime (OK time for all) but even though I accepted this alternative, after quite a long delay I was informed that I was “too slow” and that the only flight they could now offer was an Aer Lingus flight at 08.20 the following morning, less than 12 night-time hours later!

BA also sent E mail at 19.46 on 17/06/23 notifying me of the flight cancellation. Too late to contact them that day!

IMPACT ON TRAVEL PLANS

This meant that my friend (72 years old) traveling with us had to get up at 02.00 am to travel to our house and on to Dublin airport by Taxi (to arrive 2 hours before Aer Lingus departure). Our plans had been to have a relaxing (stress free) day before the long flight to Hong Kong. We intended to go the airport around 1pm and get lunch/dinner in the DAA Lounge at Dublin Airport before flying on to London. 

A bad start to our holiday.

CHECK-IN EXPERIENCE – FLIGHT to Hong Kong BA31 19/06/2023

BA could not issue boarding passes for onward flight to Bangkok (on our return BangKok airways had no problem providing boarding passes all the way to Dublin). 

Boarding announcements were unclear and all rushed forward. One of the people on check-in gave the instruction to “send them down to the pen”. This turned out to be a holding area just prior to the boarding gate, very humid, no seats, and the setting sun streaming in through large terminal 5 windows. Some people felt faint, all were uncomfortable and this before a long flight to Hong Kong.

ON BOARD - Flight to Hong Kong BA 12 08/07/2023

•	When we came on board were offered the alternative of tepid water or the worst orange juice I have ever tasted. At least my wife was served but I was ignored and had to chase down the crew to get a glass of the awful orange juice. 
•	Took two people to get seat reclined (cabin crew were unable to do it)
•	Meals were poor and lunch was served instead of breakfast (Chilli for breakfast?)
•	My wife’s seat entertainment did not work and she was offered an alternative seat beside a stranger. We had paid the hefty charges to book 4 seats together (€264 each way).
•	Went to wash teeth using amenity kit. Tooth paste could not be opened. Had to split tube to use it. 
•	Very limited drinks service during flight

RETURN FLIGHT Singapore – London – Dublin

Just some highlights from these flights.
•	Poor meal choices. risotto dry and uninteresting (on flight to London)
•	Asked for Chicken but given beef. Changed later.
•	Very limited drinks service
•	Same tepid water and poor orange juice offered after boarding
•	My wife used the cabin crew call 4 times looking for water. None came. Clambered out of seat and got it herself.
•	We were booked Business London to Dublin. Surprisingly, the BA lounge at London was very good but a little overcrowded. Check-in was chaos, they forgot to make announcements to board people in rotation. They did try to recover but it was too late. My friends (in business) were pushed to the back of the queue and were virtually last to board.
•	Flight London to Dublin, no problems, good service.

OVERALL

We booked BA because we want the comfort of “premium” on a long journey, now that we are retired. The only airline that our travel agents could offer flying the route, was BA, which would not have been our first preference. 

Thankfully, internally we used Bangkok airways which provided an excellent service in economy.

I would like to have given BA appropriate feedback in their on-line survey but the survey is cancelled after a few days, while you are still on holidays and most are unlikely to spend their time on holidays filling out lengthy surveys.",1.0,Dublin,London,Europe,June 2023,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0

"Continuous issues with Online checking. Not able to select seat, specific food preferences . Can’t believe that when other airlines are providing everything in advance at the touch of a button this airlines can not fix an issue with online checking since yesterday and they are shamelessly advising us to be there at the airport much in advance. Hope atleast our personal data will  be safe and will not be handed over to a third party for some money. We have specific food requirements and I am sure that they will raise their hands.  Better to learn one or two things from emirates  about how to handle the online portal and make the life of customer easy.

BA asked me to check my hand luggage (the only luggage I brought)  and promptly lost it. Every number I’ve called they’ve just said lines are busy and hung up. We’re only 3 days in Amsterdam with no clothes. The website says they’re still looking for the case but it’s the only one I brought for my whole Europe trip.

"We planned our honeymoon through a travel agents Sunway holidays they booked our hotel cruise and flights all we had to do was pick and pay for our seats on each flight. The night before our honeymoon when I was trying to check us in for our flights I realised our flights had been cancelled, after being on hold for a long time I then received an email with new flights but again I had to pay for seats for two different flights on top of what I had already paid for the two previous cancelled flights. We returned from honeymoon on the 6th of June and ever since I have been in contact with British airways and American Airlines but none of these companies want to take responsibility for the refund of these seats we paid for on our cancelled flights. Their customer service is absolutely appalling I have never dealt with a company that obviously doesn't care about their customer I definitely do not recommend either of these companies as they have not been helpful and we are still down the price of the seats for our cancelled flights. I have all the emails and proof that we paid for the flights directly through the airlines but yet they are saying it's the travel agents responsibility, but the travel agent didn't pay for the seats we did through the airlines.",1.0,Dublin,Punta Gorda,International,May 2023,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
"This review is based on a business class seat on BA from London to New York.  In London, once we arrived to the gate  we were crammed in a bus like a herd and taken to the plane. I had to carry my carry on up the stairs to the airplane. It is my most despised thing to do. I tolerate  it in small airports or sunny Caribbean islands. This was not proper from BA to shuttle us to the plane and then climb up the stairs. In a big airport like Heathrow and a big U.S bound plane, they could not find a gate? Once in the plane, my Business class seat was very nice and roomy. I had my own little cubicle with plenty of storage and a reclining sleeper chair. The entertainment section was pretty good too. The food was not good. I had asked gluten free, and they gave me fish. It was horrible. I would have been fine with some rice , chicken and vegetables. Majority of people eat chicken. Percentage of people eating fish is less. I also got a wrap with some chickpea in it which was horrible as well. Once we arrived Newark, our gate was not ready and we stayed in the plane for two hours.

"Flight itself was great. Service was wonderful and flight attendants were so sweet. The problem was with baggage. The airline misplaced our bags which happens sometimes, but the customer service and baggage claim people were terrible. We were told 3 separate times that our bags were going to get delivered and they never came. We had medication in our bags that was needed for me and my fiancé. We were told not to worry and they would get it to us Pronto. We didn’t have it delivered for 5 days. We had drive to go to the airport for 3 hours and get our bags. We had to buy our medication from the pharmacy and never got reimbursed for our travel fees or pharmacy fees.

Cabin crew were friendly enough however the food served was disgusting as well as being bland and dry. On my return flight I was given a diabetic half wrap which contained nothing but sliced peppers and served in a box similar to DHL delivery packaging. The wrap had been welded to the box and was discarded it as it could not be moved. If this is the best that BA can do then they had best give up or have they already.

"There was a delay on return flight from Las Vegas which meant we missed our connection Gatwick to dublin. However that was not the problem !! We were told to wait at the airport assistance by ba for my mother who is disabled to be taken at 15.00 hrs to the aer lingus desk for a 17.15 flight to dublin. We went to check in and was told we were not booked on any flight from Gatwick that day . We had no choice but to make futher arrangements and my mother finally got back to Dublin 2 days later. 
I have e mailed BA regarding this matter and what makes it worse they said we were rebooked on the 16.30 flight from Heathrow. We were not told any of this at Gatwick whilst we sat for a further 3 hours waiting to check in.
And they have the cheek to say I abandoned my trip so no compensation. BA abandoned us !!!!
I was also told by staff that push the wheelchairs at Gatwick that BA don’t actually have their own staff they are agency staff . No wonder they didn’t have a clue!!!!!
Give me virgin Atlantic anytime for my next visit to vegas! I have travelled this route over 30 times and only once with BA

"This was our last and 7 th and worst flight of our holiday absolutely intolerable . I am 5 ft 6 not tall at all and my knees were butted up against the seat in front . I got off after 9 hours and they were red raw . There was so little room between me and green seat in front that the tray couldn’t open . There was no way I could eat the offered meal . Probably a good thing as my husband tried and it was awful .
Then things got worse and the person in front reclined his seat . There was less than 6 inches between the back of his seat and my face . The stewardess would not do anything just said it was the design of the plan .
Oh and  they’ve lost our luggage said I should have gone to a desk somewhere in Nairobi airport to show them our luggage tags despite them being checked through from Zanzibar . Never ever had to do that on checked through baggage before . Certainly didn’t have to do it with Qatar on the way out .

"British Airways made heading from Boston to London a breeze. Staff was very kind and professional, and the aircraft was clean and well maintained throughout the entire flight. Despite a delay heading to Heathrow after landing, updates were continually given and the safety of the passengers remained a priority whilst we were kept waiting. Baggage claim was quick as all bags were returned to us within a reasonable amount of time, with no luggage lost.

"We booked Club Europe tickets for our latest trip to Spain. 
Being a short haul flight we would never dream of spending extra money (Easyjet always offer a much better service and for a fraction of the price) but due to my partner being a recent btk amputee we needed more room for him to accomodate the prosthetic limb. Legroom was the same as economy which caused him to have an extremely uncomfortable flight. You’d think at least we get a decent meal. That was not the case. They only offer a selection on a first come first served basis so we were in row 4 but the passengers in row 1-3 ordered what we fancied which means we were left with the options others did not chose ( and we would not have chose ourselves either).

"Writing on behalf of my family who travelled from Miami to Barcelona via Heathrow.

My family missed their connecting flight (which was still possible to make as this was also delayed) to Barcelona at Heathrow due to delays and the inability of staff to allow them to make the flight. 

Security at Heathrow also interrogated my family since they did not see the liquids (which were out of the bags). Their confusion also led the security officers to threaten arrest for no reason.

To top it off, British Airways lost my family’s luggage and were left with only 3 days worth of clothes to take o to a 7 day cruise. British Airways charged my family to fly the bags that they lost from Heathrow to Barcelona 4 days later when our cruise ship already left Barcelona which is ridiculous. To add, Lost Luggage staff at the airport was also really rude and Customer Service was useless.

Absolutely do not recommend flying through Heathrow or with British Airways when fly to Europe. Connect somewhere else.",1.0,Miami,Barcelona,International,June 2023,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0
"We chose British Airways as a supposedly better airline than the budget options due to the length of the journey. We booked well in advance but after a month or more our feeder flight at a great midday time was cancelled and we were moved onto a very early morning flight with a long wait at Heathrow (this seems to be the pattern). Our outbound flights were at least fairly pleasant once in the aircraft. The aircrew were attentive and we got food and wine. Coming home was a different experience altogether. The aircrew seemed uninterested (barely even communicating with each other) and the entertainment system did not work (no sound). We were crammed in like sardines. Then there was a 10 hour wait at Heathrow for our final flight which was very full and the crew seemed stressed and sharp with customers. I've given two stars rather than one because they did get us there and back safely but come on British Airways, you can't charge premium prices and provide cattle-truck transport.",2.0,Montreal,Manchester,International,June 2023,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0

British Airways and Heathrow Airport in general are currently a complete disaster.  Every leg of every flight we took with them this summer was either delayed or cancelled.

"Decided to treat ourselves to BA Club Europe on our recent trip.  We were hoping for a dedicated checkin but couldn’t find one, asked BA staff who were  not at all helpful.  We ended up in a long queue waiting for a machine to self checkin which we didn’t understand, then you take bags to an automated bag drop, which kept  breaking down and no staff to help you.   All in all checkin took 45 mins, so if you are travelling from LHR get there early.  No priority security with BA club Europe, so took ages.  Eventually got to lounge which was crowded, no seats, dirty, food offerings terrible, you could help yourself to Prosecco , soft drinks or spirits and stand drinking them.  Long queue for unisex toilets, which were dirty and smelly.  Staff wandering around doing nothing, very unhelpful  and unfriendly.  Altogether a depressing experience.  On the way to the gate, we passed Weatherspoons and although I am not usually a fan, it looked far more inviting than BA lounge .  No priority boarding for club Europe, just a free for all, gate staff surly, very unfriendly.  Aircraft scruffy, felt very old and jaded, no Wi-Fi or entertainment of any sort, no newspapers or magazine, just a security card.  Bit of a delay but Captain addressed passengers and sounded very professional.  Crew however were not.  On takeoff aircraft sounded like an old motor bike, engine noise excessive, almost deafening and aircraft was shaking and shuddering.  The cabin manager seemed professional but the two younger crew members were not, they didn’t appear to have had much training, mixing drinks without asking, filling glasses with a thimbleful amount of champagne, maybe economising, ran out of meals and were most unfriendly, the female was rude and condescending.  I’ve never been more pleased to reach my destination and get off that plane and put the whole miserable experience behind me.  Just to cap it all, our bags were last off flight, so no priority baggage reclaim with club Europe either.  Basically when you book BA Club Europe you get an empty seat next to you for the extra money, so if you think it’s worth it, go ahead and waste your money but I will definitely be flying with another airline, for instance, KLM, a proper airline.",1.0,London,Dubrovnik,Europe,July 2023,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0

"My girlfriend and I were scheduled to take flight BA481 from Barcelona to London Heathrow at 7:10 pm (Spain Time) and then connect to Cathay Pacific Airlines flight CX254 to Hong Kong at 10:15 pm (UK Time) on the same day. However, due to a delay of two hours on BA481, we arrived at London Heathrow at 10:00 pm (UK Time), which caused us to miss our connecting flight.

To make matters worse, all of the service counters in Heathrow Terminal 3 had closed by the time we arrived, and there were no British Airways staff available to assist us. We only received an unclear email from an automated system.

It was only with the help of Cathay Pacific staff that we found out that British Airways had unilaterally canceled our Cathay Pacific flight and rebooked us on flight on the next day at 6:00 pm. 

We were also informed that British Airways had arranged a hotel for us, but it was located in Gatwick, despite the fact that we were at Heathrow.

With the help of Cathay Pacific staff, we eventually found a British Airways service counter that was still operating. However, the male staff member on duty merely handed us a flyer with the words 'looking for help' and told us to call the number on it. He showed no willingness to assist us in resolving the problems caused by the delay.

"I bought my ticket and headed to the airport for my flight. Unfortunately the shuttle was running late so I called to notify them. 
I ended up arriving at the counter 1736 so the customer service representative at the desk told me to not worry to go and check if the American Airlines flight leaving and hour later had any seats available so she can move me to that flight and I would still make it to Heathrow in time for my connecting flight.
I went to the AA counter and they had 17 seats available. 
Upon returning to the British airways counter, there was no one at the desk, I called their 800 number and was told they would help with moving me to the AA flight, I remained on the line till they stated that it was done. 
Went back to the AA only to find out that it hadn’t been done. 
I returned to the BA counter and the lady that had promised to help me switch flights took my passport and stated that she would help me. The representatives at the AA desk told me to hurry up as they were soon closing the gate. 
My passport was later returned long after the supposed flight had already left Philadelphia and the one after it as well. 
I ended up stuck and had to buy the only flight and the most expensive flight out of Philadelphia that night.
I made numerous calls to British airlines and they declined to allow me to use the return flight and stated that they would only reimburse me $174 out of the $1374 ticket I had paid them. 
They held on to my passport causing me to be unable to get another ticket in a timely manner and caused me to have to spend over $1700 on another airline’s ticket but at least they got me to my destination in time for grandfather’s funeral on time.

"Holiday with the wife was wonderful...wish I could say the same about the return journey with BA. We up graded the seats to premium economy. We was charged extra to be able to sit together!!!! Why they charge for the upgrade and then again to book the seat...rip off charge. One of the seats was broken did not recline and was uncomfortable (lump in chair) not perfect for a night flight when we both had work the next day. I reported it to a steward who tried for ages to fix it. They must of known it was broken as the person flying out would have noticed the problem. The plane was full so could not move. The steward gave us a bottle of champagne to say sorry and promised to report it and would hear from BA when we got back. He didn't and we didn't hear a word from BA. I raised a complaint online as thats the only way. It's impossable to speak to someone in cusytomer services at BA. I got a bog standard reply offering me £50 off our next booking. Why would accept that it cost more to book the seats together never mind the upgrade cost to premium. I sent BA another email complaint and got the exact same responce word for word.

We were about 1 hr from landing, I had to wait until we arrived in Dubai to take my medicine. That was unacceptable. What if something had happened to me?! There were multiple other incidents.

I was expecting a seamless boarding on the plane, not to be.  Everyone Business, Economy push and shoving at the gate.  

Entering the aircraft I was met with a smiley crew, when presenting my boarding pass the young attendant looked in surprise and said  'oh' she had been trying to herd me into Economy. 

The ying and yang seating doesn't work, I had read that access to the toilets was clear from a window seat, no.  It was a night flight and I had to clamber over the guy seated behinds' legs.   The crew disputed that clear access not written anywhere.

In multiple years of flying, I never saw this practice. Their customer care never gave a straight answer for travel restrictions during a pandemic unlike other airlines which were clear and gave money back instead of useless credit.

Flight was delayed arriving at Gatwick by over 2 hours. Then delayed on the tarmac for another hour. After we eventually took off, the cabin crew seemed to resent anyone who asked for anything. When we landed there was no clear pickup location for our coach, not even in an email.

They cancelled our return flight out of the blue the night before, even after their call Centre had closed for the day. They didn’t even email me to tell me that it had been cancelled, I just so happened to check it, otherwise I wouldn’t have known.

"I was happy to fly back to the States from Europe on a British Airways A380 to Dallas. I hadn't flown BA in about 30 years, and I've always wanted to fly the behemoth A380. I figured this was my chance given I've heard many of these planes will soon be out of service. 

The chaos at Heathrow made for a stressful connection. It took me 90 minutes from the time I got off my plane in Terminal 3 to get to my gate in Terminal 5. The security process, in particular, was a mess. Once at the gate, people started lining up and clogging the corridor an hour before our flight was called. Then, just as we were supposed to board, we were delayed by a 'mechanical problem'. We heard very little additional information from the BA staff over the next hour. We boarded 45 minutes late, and the clog of people prevented priority passengers in early boarding groups to get through. Between the lack of clarity from gate agents and the lack of seats for a plane of this size, folks had nowhere else to go. The terrible boarding process added to our delay in getting underway.

Once aboard, I was surprised at the outdated technology on the A380. It felt very, very old. Economy had big, clunky seats with tiny monitors best controlled by ancient-looking remotes. I guess if they're going to be out of service soon the airline isn't going to upgrade them. 

In the air, the cabin crew was dynamite and the food was actually pretty good. But I wasn't sad to see that flight end. Starting in chaos meant we ended in chaos, as many people aboard the plane, including me, were behind schedule and scrambled to make connections. Also, it's never fun sitting 10 hours in a seat that fails to meet modern standards. All of this meant my BA flight wasn't as comfortable an experience as I'd hoped.",3.0,London,Dallas,International,June 2023,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,4.0
"What a disappointing experience. As soon as we settled onto our aircraft in the Premium Economy section we noticed how tired and tatty the seats were. The tray table pocket on one of the seats had no top to it and there was duct tape trying to hold it together. In one part the duct tape was worn through which would suggest that it had been there for some time. Then the ‘touch screen’ of the tv monitor just wouldn’t work. You had to use the hand controller. The foot rest just kept dropping. You either used it completely down or just left it up. Nothing in between. The pocket on the seat in front was ripped! The seat backs had to be manually pulled forward from the recline position. This aircraft was falling apart!
The drinks service came round. I ordered a vodka and tonic. Sorry no vodka! No vodka? It’s not exactly and unusual drink. The meal was then served and this was fine. Nothing special but acceptable. As we travel PE all the time we do expect a slightly better offer however it was edible. And that was that, no offer of tea or coffee or another drink. The meal was cleared away as quick as possible. There was water with the meal, the smallest bottle of water I’ve ever seen. 
During the night there were no offers of water as tends to happen on a night flight with other airlines. 
The Premium Economy cabin shared the bathroom facilities with the economy cabin, all three of them. There was always a long wait. During the night I had to alert the stewards that there was not toilet paper in the toilet I had just used. I used the last tissue instead. 
Breakfast was served. Again an ok meal but certainly nothing special for PE. You got one small cup of coffee with no more offered. 
This would have been the worst flight I have ever been on, Premium Economy or Economy. There was just a lack of maintenance and care throughout the trip and the aircraft.

No wonder so many bags get lost/delayed in Europe- ALWAYS BRITISH AIRWAYS! Their crisis management is non-existent, isn’t London their hub? And no management? UNBELIEVABLE, thanks for ruining my honeymoon!",1.0,London,Venice,Europe,May 2023,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0
"Teribile company. Flight delayed by 2h 45 hours. No explanation, poor customer service. Won't fly again, that's for sure. Most of the low cost airlines are better than BA.",1.0,Alicante,London,Europe,June 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
"Our airplane never left London to Portland Oregon do to weather. Passengers were not notified until 4 hours before the scheduled departure time from Portland Oregon. We rented a car in Seattle and drove to Portland only to rent another car to drive back to Seattle. We waited at British Airways ticket counter in Portland for several hours for a representative to show up. All flights were booked for next few days. The agent was able to book us another flight out of Seattle two days later, but in doing so they canceled my TSA pre check which I didn’t find out until security in Seattle. I had to go back to British Airways ticket counter and get that fixed. We were supposed to meet relatives in Spain on 06-13 but didn’t get too Spain until 06-15. The flight from Seattle to London , BA 52 was delayed by four hours. The seats had very little leg room and the seats were very small and uncomfortable. Not all of the meals made the flight and some people didn’t get a meal. Speaking of meals, the food was not that good. During our trip we also flew on Iberia Airlines (Excellent) Vueling Airlines (Great) American Airlines London-Chicago (Outstanding!) Alaska Airlines ( Excellent). I’m a retired Airline Captain and would be terribly disappointed and embarrassed about the management at British Airways.
